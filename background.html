      <h1>Chapter 1: Art Before History</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Concepts/ Main Ideas
          <ul>
            <li>Human expression existed across the globe before written records</li>
            <li>Very early art was produced worldwide and shared certain features- particularly concerned with the natural world and humans‚Äô place within it- art provides insight into the beginnings of ritual life</li>
            <li>1st instances of important artistic media, approaches, and values that occurred on different continents- Africa and Asia precede and influence other areas</li>
            <li>Prehistoric (Paleolithic) hunters attributed magical properties to the images they painted</li>
            <li>In Neolithic times human beings began to settle into villages and domesticate animals and food grains- this changed Neolithic man‚Äôs view of himself and the world.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Paleolithic Period
          <ul>
            <li>Man‚Äôs earliest attempts to represent his ideas and feelings in works of art have their origins some 30, 000 years ago.</li>
            <li>Variety of works produced- from simple shell necklaces to human and animal forms in ivory, clay, and stone to monumental paintings, engravings, and relief sculptures covering huge wall surfaces of caves</li>
            <li>Move from recognition to representation</li>
            <li>In caves in Southern France, Northern Spain, central Europe, Asia, and Africa see the earliest examples of man-made images and symbols.</li>
            <li>Paleolithic cavemen felt that by imitating the shapes of animals and forms of the human body they had some power over these subjects.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Paleolithic Cave Paintings
            <ul>
              <li>Some of earliest come from Africa (Namibia)</li>
              <li>Oldest paintings were portable objects (i.e. fig.1-2)</li>
              <li>Made with mineral colors from local sources</li>
              <li>Colors mixed with fat, animal blood, or some other medium</li>
              <li>Crude instruments (i.e. reeds, bristle brushes, fur, moss pads) used to fill in scratched outlines of animal‚Äôs body</li>
              <li>Wide range of color with the exception of blues and greens</li>
              <li>Even with limited tools, Prehistoric artists able to demonstrate a knowledge and affection for the animals they hunted</li>
              <li>The tendency of artists to represent animals in twisted perspective  or composite view that combines frontal and profile views of animals because want an image that is completely informative (help in the hunt?)</li>
              <li>Often lack common ground line</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Early Sculpture
            <ul>
              <li>The first sculptures were found in Europe, but sculptural works being produced in early cultures around the globe</li>
              <li>Some are even older than Namibian-painted plaques</li>
              <li>No one is really sure what their functions were or what the artisans had in mind when creating them</li>
              <li>Researches can only speculate because before had writing</li>
              <li>More figures of women than men</li>
              <li>Figures of women shown as nude although historians believe people of this time did wear clothing</li>
              <li>Sculpture could be functional objects as well</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Neolithic Period (9,000 BC to 3,000 BC)
            <ul>
              <li>Around 9000 B.C. the Ice Age gave way to a transitional period, the Neolithic- Europe became climactically, geographically, and biologically much like it is today.</li>
              <li>Humans began to settle in fixed abodes and domesticate plants and animals.  A culture developed and produced art that originated from cave paintings</li>
              <li>Paintings of humans and animals in scenes of hunt, battle, ritual dance, and harvest have been found on stone walls of shallow rock shelters along the east coast of Spain and Africa</li>
              <li>Global sculptural tradition continues</li>
              <li>Once food supply became more secure, they changed from hunters to herders, farmers, and villagers.</li>
              <li>The transition to the Neolithic period began in the ancient Near East</li>
              <li>Artists built the earth into monuments of stone and clay.</li>
              <li>Walls of dwellings were decorated as well as functional objects (i.e. clay pots)</li>
              <li>Small stone or terracotta statuettes created as well as subtly modeled human skulls reconstructed in plaster with inlaid seashells for eyes and painted hair</li>
              <li>Remains of oldest known settled communities in the grassy uplands bordering the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in Mesopotamia (portions of what is now Iraq and Syria)</li>
              <li>Regions  of early settlements provided necessary preconditions for development of agriculture- plentiful species of native plants (wheat, barley, rice, corn), rain, fertile soil</li>
              <li>In addition to agriculture, new sedentary societies originated weaving, metalworking, pottery, and counting and recording tokens</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Europe in the Neolithic Period
            <ul>
              <li>While Paleolithic paintings and sculptures abound, no comparably developed towns of time of Catal Hoyuk </li>
              <li>Local Neolithic populations in several areas developed a monumental architecture employing massive rough-cut stones</li>
              <li>Megaliths- ‚Äúgreat stones‚Äùü°™ megalithic culture</li>
              <li>Plentiful megalithic monuments in Europe</li>
              <li>Arrangement of huge stones in a circle (cromlech or henge), often surrounded by a ditch, almost entirely limited to Britain</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <h1>Greek UNIT 2</h1>
            
              <li>Concepts and Main Ideas
                <ul>
                  <li>Life for the Greek was a glorious struggle-their art focuses on the events and achievements in this life</li>
                  <li>"Future ages will wonder at us, as the present age wonders at us now." Pericles</li>
                  <li>"For we are lovers of the beautiful, yet simple in our tastes, and we cultivate the mind without the loss of manliness‚Ä¶[we are] the school of Hellas" Pericles</li>
                  <li>Greek cultural focus- ideal humanistic education and life</li>
                  <li>The humanistic worldview led the Greeks to create the concept of democracy</li>
                  <li>Greeks believed in many gods and goddesses who differed only from human beings in that they were immortal</li>
                  <li>Creating the perfect individual became the Greek ideal</li>
                  <li>Finest products of Greek civilization created in Athens</li>
                  <li>Athenian aim was to achieve a balance of intellectual and physical discipline, an ideal of humanistic education-"a sound mind in a sound body"</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Geometric/ Orientalizing Period (7th century BCE)
                <ul>
                  <li>Disintegration of Bronze Age social order and destruction of Mycenaean palaces send Greece into a Dark Age- loss of knowledge of how to read, write, cut stone/ masonry, build citadels and tombs, paint frescos, and sculpt in stone- also period of depopulation- conditions too unsettled to allow art to develop- production of some ceramics continues during this Dark Age</li>
                  <li>In 8th century, economic conditions improve and population begins to grow- Greeks break out of isolation and begin to trade with other cultures</li>
                  <li>Arts reemerge beginning with ceramics and small bronze figures</li>
                  <li>Artistic period gets the name "Geometric" from heavy reliance on use of simple geometric shapes and forms for decoration of vessels and creation of forms</li>
                  <li>Sometimes called "Orientalizing" period because of Greek trade with the Ancient Near East</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            
          </li>
          <li>Archaic Period (600-480 BCE)
            <ul>
              <li>See enormous influence of Egyptian canon on the art and architecture of the Greeks</li>
              <li>Continuous refinement of human form in sculpture, but no indication of weight shift in stances</li>
              <li>Temples begin to be constructed of more permanent materials like marble and limestone- use models of Egyptian columnar halls like hypostyle hall from Temple of Amen-Re at Karnak</li>
              <li>Figural sculpture plays major role in decoration of temples- partly to tell about deity who resided within and partly to serve the idea of temple as a votive offering to deity</li>
              <li>Athenian Agora first constructed- functioned as a center of all community life</li>
              <li>Use of the Archaic smile</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Early (480-450 BCE) and High (450-400 BCE) Classical Periods
            <ul>
              <li>Classical Period begins with the Greek defeat of the Persians</li>
              <li>Decades following the removal of the Persian threat are generally considered the high point of Greek Civilization</li>
              <li>Early Classical period is sometimes called the "Severe Style" because in both attitude and dress their figures are more serious and have a severity that contrasts with the smiling and elaborately dressed figures of the Late Archaic period</li>
              <li>Early Classical sculptors are the 1st to break away from the rigid and unnatural Egyptian-inspired pose of the Archaic Kourous figures</li>
              <li>Focus on community and the ideal world of perfect beings and perfect buildings</li>
              <li>A change in posture in sculpture can be seen in figures from the Temple of Zeus and the Athenian Acropolis as sculptors become more concerned with how people really stand</li>
              <li>Use of contrapposto ("weight shift") becomes the norm (ex.Kritios Boy) as natural motion in space replaces the rigid frontality of the Archaic Period</li>
              <li>Polykleitos's treatise lays out the rules for creating a perfect statue by using mathematical formulae and calculations. His work Doryphorous (Spear Bearer) was created to illustrate his treatise.</li>
              <li>Emphasis on rationality, mathematical ratios, symmetry, and balance in sculpture and architecture</li>
              <li>Period of Pericles and construction of Athenian Acropolis complex</li>
              <li>Use of heavy "wet" drapery to define the figure underneath the clothing</li>
              <li>Only painting we have from this period is vase painting, which also shows a focus on naturalism and accuracy through the use of foreshortening- no more composite views with frontal eyes on profile heads</li>
              <li>In vase painting see the addition of landscape elements and elimination of single ground line which is tremendous break from previous periods which relied heavily on a common ground line which all the figures stood/ sat/ moved on</li>
              <li>The art from this period reflects a peaceful, serene idealism- there is no show of emotion</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Late Classical Period (400-323 BCE)
            <ul>
              <li>Peloponnesian War (431-404 BCE) left Greece weak</li>
              <li>This war and the political strife that would follow brought an end to the serene idealism of 5th century Greek Art</li>
              <li>Art begins to focus more on the individual and real world appearance</li>
              <li>Themes of High Classical period still used- still depicted gods and goddesses with superhuman beauty, but lose some of their solemn grandeur and take on sense of worldly sensuousness that illustrates humanizing spirit of the culture- they are no longer awesome and remote figures</li>
              <li>Focus on a beauty that appeals more to the eye than to the mind- no longer focus on majestic strength and rational design</li>
              <li>Throughout Archaic and Early and High Classical periods, Greek sculptors shared common goals, but in Late Classical period of the 4th century, have distinctive individual styles develop</li>
              <li>3 major Late Classical Sculptors- Praxiteles, Skopas of Paros, and Lysippos of Sikyon</li>
              <li>Period of Alexander the Great and the Macedonian Court- end date for Late Classical period is the year Alexander died (323 BCE)</li>
              <li>Use of mosaics for decoration popular</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Hellenistic Period (323-31 BCE)
            <ul>
              <li>Alexander conquered Egypt and Ancient Near East, creating a vast empire which ended up being divided among his generals after his death</li>
              <li>There were several cultural centers/ court cities in the Greek Empire- Antioch (Syria), Pergamon (Asia Minor), Alexandria (Egypt)</li>
              <li>An international culture and the Greek language united the Hellenistic world</li>
              <li>Time of small, heroic city-states passed away along with power and prestige of Athens- a cosmopolitan society took their place</li>
              <li>After death of Alexander, empire divided up among Hellenistic kings who became rich on spoils of war and goods from the East</li>
              <li>Greater variety, complexity, and sophistication of the Hellenistic culture called for architecture on an imperial scale with a great degree of diversity- there were larger needs to serve and requirements to meet than what had previously been expected of the Classical city-states</li>
              <li>Period ends with defeat of Anthony and Cleopatra and Greek fall to Roman power</li>
              <li>Building activity shifts from Greek mainland to opulent cities of the Hellenistic monarchs in Asia Minor because locations more central to the entire Hellenistic world</li>
              <li>Architecture characterized by great scale, theatrical element of surprise, & willingness to break away from old canons of temple design</li>
              <li>In sculpture, much more drama and action- tumultuous narratives, violent movement, swirling draperies, vivid depictions of death and suffering- dramatic motion and emotion</li>
              <li>Use of very deep carving on sculptures to create dark shadow- this creates heightened sense of drama using play of light and dark</li>
              <li>Twisting, theatrical gestures and emotional intensity of works reflect political turbulence as empire begins to decline and attempts to fend off Romans</li>
              <li>Rejection of idea that a statue has to be ideally a proportioned, self-contained entity on a bare pedestal- Hellenistic works interact with their environments and appear as living, breathing, and intensely emotive human/ divine presences</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Early (480-450 BCE) and High (450-400 BCE) Classical Periods

          <h1>The Etruscans unit 3</h1>
          <li>The Etruscans
            <ul>
              <li>Occupied northern and middle regions of Italy in early Roman days, then taken over by Romans because of lack of cohesion in Etruscan city-states</li>

        <ul>
            <li>A diverse population of Roman Empire - range of social, ethnic, racial, linguistic, and religious backgrounds</li>
            <li>During 3rd and 4th century, shift from polytheism to monotheism</li>
            <li>Dura-Europos - founded shortly after death of Alexander the Great; ‚ÄúPompei of the desert;‚Äù microcosm of different religious currents of late antiquity; extensive mural program in Synagogue; Christian community house</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Early Christianity</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Christianity attractive for the poor b/c found promise in the afterlife; also rich and poor have equal status and judged equally in the afterlife</li>
            <li>Christians persecuted by the Romans because:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Christians had alien beliefs about the incarnation of a god as a man and his resurrection to save the human race</li>
            <li>Christians refused to pay even token homage to Roman state‚Äôs official gods</li>
            <li>Romans feared Christianity would weaken imperial authority</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Romans cremated their dead; Christians opposed to cremation because of their views on the afterlife - increase in number of sarcophagi as Christianity grew; proper burial important</li>
            <li>Early examples of early Christian art is from the catacombs</li>
            <li>Edict of Milan in 313 - end persecution of Christians - can worship openly and convert people - prior to this, Christianity had status of a sect or cult</li>
            <li>Christians buried outside the city - families would join money together and buy land for burial - create Christian confraternity</li>
            <li>Some early Christian churches built on sites above catacombs so could worship at burial site of early Christian martyrs</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Early Christian Motifs and Iconography</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Art of early Christianity is primarily for funerary purposes - decorate catacombs and sarcophagi</li>
            <li>Themes of interest include the Good Shepherd, scenes form the Life of Christ, Old Testament miracles which prefigure the sacrifice and resurrection of Christ (exs - story of Jonah and the whale, sacrifice of Isaac, story of Adam and Eve), orant figures</li>
            <li>Ceilings of chapel areas in catacombs (cubicula) painted in the ‚Äúspoke-and-wheel‚Äù style seen before in Ostia - use a central medallion and lunettes to create design</li>
            <li>Images of God and Christ not used - concern over creating ‚Äúgraven images,‚Äù which is against the teachings in the Bible</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Early Christian Architecture</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once Christianity received imperial approval under Constantine, there is a need for Christian churches</li>
            <li>Christian churches had to meet requirements of Christian liturgy, provide a suitable place to celebrate the Christian faith, and accommodate the growing number of worshippers</li>
            <li>Roman emperor and obligated to protect ancient Roman religion, traditions, etc, however, Constantine was eager to provide buildings and burial sites for Christian rituals - he is 1st major patron of Christian architecture and builds basilicas, memorials, mausoleum for Christians in Rome, Constantinople and other sacred sites of the religion like Bethlehem and Jerusalem</li>
            <li>Old St. Peter‚Äôs - greatest of all of Constantine‚Äôs churches; on spot where believed St. Peter was buried - built over old cemetery; could hold 3000-4000 worshippers; resembles Roman basilicas and audience halls like Basilica Ulpia in Trajan‚Äôs forum - do not follow Greco-Roman temple design; **know plan of Old St. Peter‚Äôs</li>
            <li>Basilica plans (St. Peter‚Äôs) vs. Central plans (Santa Costanza)</li>
            
              </ul>
              <li>The Art of Mosaics</li>
              <ul>
                <li>First mosaics used pebbles set into cement - designs were uncomplicated, confined to geometric shapes, and generally monochrome - lead strips were used for linear definition</li>
                <li>In mid 3rd century, new kind of mosaic invented that used tesserae (tiny cut stones) - this gave the artist a lot more flexibility b/c could adjust size and shape of pieces to fit the needs of their designs - no longer have to use lead strips in design to show contours and interior details</li>
                <li>By 4th century, mosaics had developed a high level of sophistication - used broad range of colors, shading, setting, and clothing to suggest 3-d volume</li>
                <li>Tesserae allow for greater gradations in color like we saw in Battle of Issus mosaic from Pompei</li>

                  <li>Tesserae used in Early Christian mosaics made of cut glass - makes surfaces sparkle; Romans preferred opaque marble pieces instead</li>
                  <li>Standard way to decorate walls and vaults in Early Christian buildings b/c caught the light flooding in through the windows and gave vibrant reflection - this produced sharp contrasts and concentrations of color that could focus attention on the most central, relevant features of a composition</li>
                  <li>Not meant to incorporate subtle tonal changes of naturalistic painter‚Äôs approach - colors are placed, not blended - this created bright, hard, glittering texture with a rigidly simplified pattern</li>
                  <li>Mostly situated in high places, so use larger tesserae than floor mosaics and pieces set unevenly so surfaces could catch and reflect light</li>
                  <li>Used simple design so easy to read from the ground</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Byzantine Background</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Constantine founded a ‚Äúnew Rome‚Äù in Constantinople on the old Greek city of Byzantium in 324 - changed name to Constantinople</li>
              <li>Roman Empire falls apart in 5th century - 2 emperors established - one ruled the West from Milan and Ravenna (capital would be moved); the other ruled the East from Constantinople - this division is permanent</li>
              <li>Eastern Christian Empire called ‚ÄúByzantium‚Äù - use the term ‚ÄúByzantine‚Äù to identify whatever pertains to this empire as far as territory, history, and culture but Byzantine emperors did not use this term to refer to themselves - still called themselves ‚ÄúRomans‚Äù</li>
              <li>Spoke Greek, not Latin like in the West</li>
              <li>Emperors never relinquish their claims as legitimate successors of Roman emperors</li>
              <li>Religion of empire was Orthodox Christianity - official faith</li>
              <li>Emperors considered quasi-divine</li>
              <li>Hard to make absolute political and religious unity a reality because still had a diverse population</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Early Byzantine Art (527-726)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Golden Age under reign of Justinian and his consort, Empress Theodora</li>
                <li>Art is a cultural mix of Roman, Christian, and eastern influences in the art of Byzantium.</li>
                <li>Rise of Justinian marks the end of the late Roman Empire and the beginning of the Byzantine Empire</li>
                <li>Byzantine art emerges as a novel and distinctive style - leaves behind the feelings of uncertainty and hesitation of Eastern Christian Art</li>
                <li>Can recognize sources in Late Antique Art but had new and independent power of invention - expressed unique character of the Eastern Christian cult of Constantine</li>
                <li>Justinian held his own as home and abroad against all challenges to his power - starts ambitious building program - costs a lot of money for the people in taxes - these buildings defined Byzantine style in architecture forever</li>
                <li>Art is ideal vehicle for conveying extremely complex symbolism of fully developed Christian dogma</li>
                <li>Shapes and figures have lost volume of earlier mosaics - have flat silhouettes with linear details - effect is rich, flat tapestry without illusionistic devices</li>
                <li>Use of gold for backgrounds - very few blue skies and little use of architectural or landscape elements - gold creates otherworldly feel and give perspective of paradise of afterlife</li>
                <li>Little use of cast shadows or modeling in light and shadow - any attempt at shading looks like stripes</li>

              <li>At the time, faithful would burn incense, kneel in front of icons, and pray for protection, cure for illness, etc - purpose of icon to evoke presence of holy figures people addressing in their prayers</li>
              <li>Icon veneration becomes confused with idol worship</li>
              <li>Series of crises in the 7th and 8th centuries left Byzantium fighting for survival - this ends both period of Imperial Rome and the Early Byzantine period</li>
              <li>In 7th centuries, series of calamities erupted which indirectly caused a ban on images - Byzantine Empire lost 2/3 of its territory - lost cities, wealth, people - Pope Leo III of Christian Roman Empire said God was punishing them for idolatrous worship, and in 726, he prohibited the use of images - very little religious figurative art for the next 100 years</li>

  <h1>The Islamic world unit 4</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Background Information on Islam
      <ul>
        <li>Religion of Islam (Arabic word meaning ‚Äúsubmission to God‚Äù) arose among people of Arabian Peninsula in early 7th century.</li>
        <li>People of this region primarily nomadic since ancient times, but had settled and controlled the coastal regions.</li>
        <li>When Islam arose, Arabs on the periphery of the Byzantine and Persian empires, but in a little over a century, the Mediterranean was an ‚ÄúIslamic lake‚Äù</li>
        <li>Speed and swiftness of spread of Islam is among wonders of world history</li>
        <li>Irresistible and far-ranging sweep of Islam from Arabia to India to North Africa and Spain</li>
        <li>Ottoman Turks cause fall of Byzantine Empire when take Constantinople in 1453</li>
        <li>Some regions successfully oppose the Muslim onslaught- Charles Martel and the Franks held them back in 8th century, Ferdinand and Isabella rid Spain of Muslims in 1492</li>
        <li>Islam is one of the world‚Äôs great religions and appealed to millions of converts- Muslims on every continent in the world</li>
        <li>Sophistication of culture has had impact around the world</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Impact and Influence of Islam
      <ul>
        <li>Christian scholars in the West during 12th and 13th centuries eagerly studied Arabic translations of Aristotle and other Greek writers from Antiquity</li>
        <li>Arabic love lyrics and poetic descriptions of nature inspired early French troubadours</li>
        <li>Arab scholars laid foundations of arithmetic, algebra and made contributions to astronomy, medicine, natural sciences</li>
        <li>Islam‚Äôs triumph brought new and compelling tradition to world art and architecture- largely replaces art of antiquity in Middle East and North Africa; because of foothold in Spain, also influences Western medieval art; also bring their distinctive style to South Asia when Sultanate established in India at Delhi</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Foundations and Beliefs of Islamic Faith</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Essential meaning of Islam is acceptance and submission to Allah‚Äôs will</li>
      <li>Muhammad is the founder of Islam and revered as its Final Prophet- he was critical of polytheistic religion of his fellow Arabs, so he preached religion of a one and only God that he received revelations</li>
      <li>Muhammad was a merchant from Mecca- had 1st religious experience in 610 when visited by Angel Gabriel and instructed to recite- these divine recitations form the Koran (Qu‚Äôran) which is organized into 114 verses (suras/ surahs)</li>
      <li>Followers of Islam are called Muslims (‚Äúthose who submit‚Äù)</li>
      <li>Islam requires living according to the rules laid down in the collected revelations communicated through Muhammad during his lifetime</li>
      <li>These revelations are recorded in the Koran (Islam‚Äôs sacred book)- Koran means ‚Äúrecitations‚Äù and is a reference to the archangel Gabriel‚Äôs instructions to Muhammad in 610 to ‚Äúrecite in the name of Allah‚Äù</li>
      <li>In 622, opposition to Muhammad‚Äôs message prompted the Prophet and his followers to flee from Mecca (his native home on the coast of Arabia) to a desert oasis called Medina (‚ÄúCity of the Prophet‚Äù)- this flight is known as the Hijra (emigration)</li>
      <li>Eight years later in 630, Muhammad returned to Mecca with his soldiers and took control of the city, converted the population to Islam, and destroyed all the idols in the Kaaba</li>
      <li>When he took over, Muhammad preserved the Kaaba ‚Äì the Islamic world‚Äôs symbolic center which is a small cubical building which had housed the idols because the it was associated with the era of Abraham and Ishmael, the common ancestors of Jews and Arabs</li>
      <li>Muhammad dies in 632</li>
      <li>When he took over, Muhammad preserved the Kaaba ‚Äì the Islamic world‚Äôs symbolic center which is a small cubical building which had housed the idols because the it was associated with the era of Abraham and Ishmael, the common ancestors of Jews and Arabs</li>
      <li>Muhammad dies in 632- Muslims believe he was the final in a line of prophets that included Moses, Abraham, and Jesus</li>
      <li>Muhammad succeeded by the four ‚Äúrightly-guided) Caliphs (khalifa or ‚Äúsuccessor‚Äô in Arabic)- one of whom was his son-in-law Ali</li>
      <li>Shi‚Äôa Muslim vs. Sunni Muslim</li>
      <li>Islam has Five Pillars, or binding obligations, for its followers:
        <ul>
          <li>THE SHAHADA- Profession of faith in one God (Allah)</li>
          <li>SALAT- Daily prayers- worship five times
            <li>ZAKAT- Giving alms to the poor</li>
            <li>SAUM-Fast during the month of Ramadan</li>
            <li>HAJJ- Pilgrimage to Mecca at least once if possible</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Muslims live their lives according to the revelations in the Koran as well as Muhammad‚Äôs life- customs and ways of the Prophet are collected in the Sunnah, a supplement to Koran that offers guidance on ethical problems of every day life to the faithful</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Islamic Painting and Sculpture</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Three types of patterns- Arabesque, calligraphy, and tessellations. Used on everything, monuments to plates.</li>
                <li>Arabesque motifs= acanthus and spilt leaves</li>
                <li>Calligraphy= script (kufic, hard to read, for the elite, used in the Qur‚Äôan)</li>
                <li>Tessellations= repetition= the islamic belief that there is unity in multiplicity.</li>
                <li>Geometric patterns= universe is based on logic & clear design</li>

    <h1>Islamic Architecture</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Comparing Islam, Judaism, and Christianity</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Islam:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>incorporates Old Testament teachings- sober ethical standards, hatred of idol worship</li>
          <li>incorporates New Testament Gospels</li>
          <li>acknowledges Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus as prophetic predecessors of Muhammad, who was the final and greatest of the Prophets</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Muhammad:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>did not claim to be divine like Jesus and he did not perform miracles</li>
          <li>was God‚Äôs messenger- considered purifier and perfecter of the common faith of Jews, Christians, and Muslims in one God</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Islam is simpler in terms of organization- Muslims worship God directly- there is no hierarchy of rabbis, priests, or saints acting as intermediaries</li>
        <li>In Islam, as Muhammad defined it, religious and secular power were united completely</li>
        <li>After Muhammad, caliphs (Arabic for ‚Äúsuccessor‚Äù) continued practice of uniting religious and secular leadership in one ruler</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Islamic Worship and Architecture</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Islamic religious architecture closely related to Muslim prayer, which is an obligation of ALL Muslims according to the Koran</li>
        <li>Worship can be private or communal, but is largely communal- no special place have to pray or ceremony have to perform--important that you pray five times a day</li>
        <li>Mosque: Islamic house of worship- all have some standard features</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Quibla: the only element important in worship- this is the direction to which Muslims pray- must pray toward the direction of Mecca</li>
          <li>Muslim Sabbath is on Friday- community convenes each Friday at noon</li>
          <li>Imam: leader of collective worship</li>
          <li>Minbar: a stepped pulpit from which Imam leads worship- usually set up in front of the southern (or quibla) wall</li>
          <li>Congregational Mosque/ Great Mosque/ Friday Mosque: house of worship large enough to accommodate a community‚Äôs entire population for Friday noonday prayer</li>
          <li>Mihrab: semicircular niche set into the quibla wall- often marked by dome over the bay in front of it- origin, purpose, meaning still debated- maybe marks spot where Muhammad stood when led worship</li>
          <li>Maqsura: precedes the mihrab- area generally reserved for ruler or his representative; may not be present in all mosques; tends to be elaborate in form</li>
          <li>Minarets: towers from which faithful are called to worship</li>
          <li>Hypostyle halls: communal worship halls with roofs held up by a multitude of columns; seen in early mosques</li>
          <li>Iwan: variation found in later mosque- usually four of them- rectangular recessed- one on each side of the courtyard</li>
          <li>All mosques are oriented towards Mecca regardless of their plans(central-plan vs other rectilinear layouts)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Sinan the Great</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Considered the best architect in all the Ottoman Empire--Perfected the Ottoman Mosque architecture and worked for many great rulers, such as Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent and Sultan Selim II.</li>
        <li>Credited with addressing and solving the issue of a unified, central space that is BOTH monumental in structure and harmonious in proportion and decorative elements.</li>
        <li>Born a Christian in ca. 1491- converted to the Islamic faith and began his career as an Islamic government official</li>
        <li>Noticed as a talented architect and placed as head of architectural affairs under Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent.</li>
        <li>His Christian background was a driving force in the development of the Mosque of Selim II because it allowed him to develop a plan that rivaled Hagia Sophia in Istanbul (Constantinople).</li>

      <h1>Early Medieval Art unit 4</h1>
      
        <li>Early Medieval Period
          <ul>
            <li>The period between 400-1400 was referred to as Dark Ages because it was considered rough, uncivilized, crude, and primitive artistically</li>
            <li>The period is thought of as the blank between two civilizations- the Roman Empire and the Renaissance</li>
            <li>Most scholars stopped seeing the art of this period as unsophisticated long ago</li>
            <li>The early Middle Ages is the period from 500-1000- art from this period represents a fusion of Christianity, Greco-Roman heritage, and the cultures of the non-Roman peoples North of the Alps</li>
            <li>Over centuries, a new order replaces what had been the Roman empire, involving the merging of Roman and non-Roman cultures which developed their own social and political institutions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Artistic Overview of the Early Medieval Period
          <ul>
            <li>As the Roman empire declined, there were conflicts with non-European peoples competing for political authority such as the Huns, Vandals, Merovingians, Franks, and Goths (also called the Warrior Lords Period)</li>
            <li>We have no idea of the full range of art of these peoples, but do have some surviving works- primarily small "status symbols" like weapons and items of personal adornment- most of which are characteristics of prestige ornaments like the fibula</li>
            <li>These items show a great degree of technical and stylistic sophistication</li>
            <li>The Christianization of the British Isles leads to a hybrid artistic style combining Viking aesthetics with Christian iconography</li>
            <li>Monasteries were centers of artistic production, including illuminated manuscripts</li>
            <li>There was an attempt in the later part of the period to unify territory and recapture the greatness of the Christian Roman Empire- the Holy Roman Empire began under Charlemagne and continued to the 19th century as a major power in Europe</li>
            <li>Art from this period has an overall sense of an attempt to revive the classical past by using classical models, but does not have the naturalism or realism of antiquity- the focus is on Christian dogma and imperial power</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Vikings (Warrior Lords) and their Art
          <ul>
            <li>In 793, the Vikings set sail for Scandinavia and landed in the British Isles</li>
            <li>They destroyed Christian monastic communities at Lindisfarne Island and also attacked monasteries in Scotland and England</li>
            <li>From 793 until the 11th century, the Vikings were a terror in Western Europe</li>
            <li>They had exceptional talent for organization and administration as well as war</li>
            <li>The art of the Viking sea rovers is associated with their great wooden ships and examples of their art can be found in ship burials</li>
            <li>The artistic traditions of the Vikings in Europe were applied to a variety of media such as wood, stone, and metal- much of their art consists of highly decorated functional objects</li>
            <li>Imagery in the artwork includes intertwined ribbon-like designs called interlacing as well as abstract animal imagery- these design features reflect the cultures of pre-Christian Northern Europe</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Hiberno-Saxon Art
          <ul>
            <li>In 432, St. Patrick established the church in Ireland and christianized the Celts</li>
            <li>Because of geographic isolation, the monastic orders in Ireland differed from the Church of Rome in liturgical practices and holidays</li>
            <li>Irish monks set up monasteries in Britain and Scotland and began to convert people</li>
            <li>Hiberno-Saxon art is also referred to as insular art because it comes from the Irish-English islands</li>
            <li>Insular art flourished in monasteries</li>
            <li>The most distinctive product of insular art was illuminated manuscripts- books were the primary way of christianizing the British Isles</li>
            <li>Illuminations brought the word of God to primarily illiterate people</li>
            <li>Books were handwritten and hand-copied by monks, so they are very scarce and regarded as treasures</li>
            <li>Different types of books produced during this time include the Pentateuch, Gospels, lectionaries, benedictorials, and the Book of Hours</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Hiberno-Saxon Illuminated Manuscripts
          <ul>
            <li>Hiberno-Saxon illuminated manuscripts are known for their use of interlace patterns (horror vacui) and animal style, a medieval art form in which animals are depicted in a stylized and complicated pattern, fighting with one another</li>
            <li>Each section of the manuscripts starts with an oversized initial</li>
            <li>The manuscripts also feature rich color fields</li>
            <li>The artists of these books had an exceptional handling of color and form</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <h1>Unit 5 Romanesque Art</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Background on the Romanesque Era
        <ul>
          <li>The Romanesque era is the first period since the Archaic and Classical Greek periods to take its name from an artistic style rather than politics or geography</li>
          <li>"Romanesque" is a title invented by art historians to describe an artistic phenomenon/style of this particular time period- it means "Roman-like"</li>
          <li>The term was first used in the 19th century to describe European architecture of the 11th and 12th centuries because certain architectural elements like barrel vaults and groin vaults resembled ancient Roman architecture</li>
          <li>The term broadly designates the 150 year period from 1050-1200</li>
          <li>During the early Middle Ages, there was a feudal system in place, but the growth of towns and cities during the Romanesque period gradually replaced the feudal system as the governing political, social, and economic system of the Late Middle Ages</li>
          <li>Monasteries and churches were separated from the busy secular life of Romanesque towns</li>
          <li>During the 11th and 12th centuries, thousands of ecclesiastical buildings were either remodeled or newly built and the construction of churches became an obsession</li>
          <li>The economic investment in religious buildings and their furnishings was also a reflection of the significant increase in pilgrim traffic in Romanesque Europe- pilgrims were an important source of revenue for monasteries that possessed relics of venerated saints</li>
          <li>Romanesque architecture incorporates the widespread use of stone vaults in 11th and 12th century churches, which inspired the term "Romanesque"</li>
          <li>Despite regional variations, all Romanesque buildings manifest a new, widely shared method of architectural thinking- a new logic of design and construction</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Background: The Impact of Pilgrimages (continued)
        <ul>
          <li>Pilgrimage was most conspicuous feature of public devotion- proclamation of a pilgrim‚Äôs faith</li>
          <li>Major shrines were St. Peter‚Äôs and St. Paul‚Äôs in Rome and Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem</li>
          <li>Visitors braved bad roads and hostile forests/wildernesses which were filled with robbers- did it for salvation's sake</li>
          <li>Many times, people undertook pilgrimage as an act of repentance or because they were seeking healing</li>
          <li>Pilgrims fostered the growth of towns</li>
          <li>Pilgrims were the primary and conceptual catalyst for the art and architecture of the Romanesque period</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Important Elements of Romanesque Architecture
        <ul>
          <li>Stone vaulting was used to replace timber roofs to help with fire-proofing and acoustics</li>
          <li>The nave, transept, and side aisles were added to existing churches or expanded to accommodate larger crowds of pilgrims</li>
          <li>The crossing square, where the nave meets the transept, may be covered by a dome and also functions as the basic unit of measure for building</li>
          <li>Transverse arches are rounded arches that break up the nave into bays</li>
          <li>Bays are units that divide the nave and create a modular plan for the church- they may be barrel-vaulted (earlier) or groin-vaulted (later)</li>
          <li>The ambulatory is a major innovation that allows pilgrims to walk behind the mass in the apse and visit radiating chapels- it facilitates the viewing of relics</li>
          <li>Radiating chapels are off of the ambulatory and are used to hold relics</li>
          <li>The gallery/tribune level was added to accommodate overflow crowds</li>
          <li>The clerestory was used to allow light in and is usually small in Romanesque churches</li>
          <li>A barrel vault is the norm for vaulting in Romanesque naves- bays are vaulted (not a continuous barrel vault for the length of the nave)</li>
          <li>A groin vault is less common for vaulting in Romanesque churches and is used more in side aisles- it will eventually replace barrel-vaulting in the nave in the Gothic period</li>
          <li>The portal and its parts are the entranceway into the church and are decorated with sculptures that were used to educate the largely illiterate public about salvation and damnation</li>
          <li>The cloister is an enclosed garden or meditative space with an ambulatory found in monastic abbey churches</li>
          <li>A cruciform structure is cross-shaped and is commonly seen in medieval churches with the addition of a transept- it is also symbolic for Christians</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Romanesque Churches
        <ul>
          <li>Romanesque churches have specific characteristics, including: a basilica plan with a transept, increased nave length, extended or double side aisles, an apse with an ambulatory, radiating chapels, upper level galleries (tribunes), barrel vaulting (later groin vaulting), compound piers, and a segmented vaulted interior space</li>
          <li>Romanesque architects made many changes to early Christian church plans in order to accommodate large numbers of congregants and to help ensure the building's longevity, including increasing the nave length and extending the aisles</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Painting
        <ul>
          <li>The art of painting did not need to be "revived" because it was still alive in illuminated manuscripts and mural painting</li>
          <li>There are an unprecedented number of preserved frescoes and illuminated books from this time period</li>
          <li>Just like architecture and sculpture, there was regional and stylistic diversity in painting</li>
          <li>Despite Muslim control across the Iberian Peninsula (present-day Spain and Portugal), there was still Christianity and Christian art</li>
          <li>Romanesque painting is still lacking in realism in the modeling of figures and drapery, with elongated human forms and schematized patterns for fabric folds</li>
          <li>There was a great demand for illuminated manuscripts and an instinct for decorative surface patterns</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <h1>Unit 5 Gothic Art</h1>
      <li>Background on Gothic Period
        <ul>
          <li>The term "Gothic" was first used in the mid-16th century by Giorgio Vasari, the "father of art history," to describe late medieval art and architecture- he thought it was "monstrous and barbarous" art like something invented by the Goths</li>
          <li>This idea reinforces the fact that people thought of the Middle Ages as a period of artistic decline</li>
          <li>In the 13th and 14th centuries, this style was "all the rage" in most of Europe- it was still thought of as "modern" or "French"</li>
          <li>The clergy and lay public alike regarded new cathedrals as images of the city of God, the Heavenly Jerusalem- they felt they had the privilege to create this on Earth</li>
          <li>The style first appears in Northern France in 1140, and there is some overlap with the Romanesque period</li>
          <li>By the 13th century, the style from the region around Paris had spread throughout Europe</li>
          <li>Gothic would become internationally acclaimed, but was largely a regional style</li>
          <li>It is important to remember that in the eastern and southern parts of Europe, Islamic and Byzantine styles were flourishing</li>
          <li>The Gothic period was a time of both prosperity and turmoil in Europe- there was the plague/Black Death, the Great Schism (two popes), and a time of profound change- the focus of intellectual and religious life shifted from monasteries in the country and pilgrimage churches to the rapidly expanding cities with great new cathedrals reaching up to the sky</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Gothic: How it Started
        <ul>
          <li>There were several factors that contributed to the emergence of the Gothic style, including peace and prosperity from 987-1328, the growing wealth of cities and towns, a shift in focus from agriculture to goods and services, and the emergence of schools in Paris (which became an intellectual capital)</li>
          <li>Three crucial historical events also played a role in the development of the Gothic style: the Hundred Years' War (France vs England, which left France ruined), the Babylonian Captivity (in which the Pope left Rome and the city fell, leading to a period of conflict known as the Great Schism), and the Black Death of 1348 (a plague in which an estimated 1/4 to 1/3 of the world's population died- this event was seen as punishment from God and led to a return to religion)</li>
        </ul>
