        <h1>127. The Steerage Alfred Stieglitz. 1907 C.E. Photogravure</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>The scene depicts a variety of men and women traveling in the lowerclass section of a steamer going from New York to Bremen, Germany. </li>
              <li>Said Stieglitz: "There were men and women and children on the lower
                deck of the steerage. There was a narrow stairway leading to the upper
                deck of the steerage, a small deck right on the bow of the steamer.
                To the left was an inclining funnel and from the upper steerage
                deck there was fastened a gangway bridge that was glistening in
                its freshly painted state. It was rather long, white, and during the
                trip remained untouched by anyone. On the upper deck, looking
                over the railing, there was a young man with a straw hat. The
                shape of the hat was round. He was watching the men and
                women and children on the lower steerage deck…A round straw
                hat, the funnel leaning left, the stairway leaning right, the white
                drawbridge with its railing made of circular chains – white
                suspenders crossing on the back of a man in the steerage
                below, round shapes of iron machinery, a mast cutting into the
                sky, making a triangular shape…I saw shapes related to each
                other. I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I
                had about life."</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>While traveling to visit relatives he was walking around the ship (most
                likely still in port because of the shadows and lack of wind) and saw the scene
                and ran back to his cabin to grab his camera, had to wait a week to develop the
                negative. He said he immediately knew it was a milestone in photography, but
                this was challenged by his biographers who pointed out that “he didn't publish it
                until 1911 and didn't exhibit it until 1913.”
              <ul>
                <li>It was only after Stieglitz began to seriously consider the works of
                  modern American artists like John Marin, Arthur Dove and Weber that he
                  finally published the image.</li>

          </li>
          <li>Form</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Like the works of those artists,The Steerage is "divided,
              fragmented and flattened into an abstract, nearly cubistic design"[9] and it
              has been cited as one of the first proto-Cubist works of art</li>
