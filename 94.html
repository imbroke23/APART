            <li>Two faces of the screen: one has a hunting scene, and the other has a war scene(The Siege of Belgrade)
            </li>
            <li>The hunting scene is suited to an intimate space for small receptions
            </li>
            <li>
              The hunting scene is based on tapestry designs for the Medici, a great family of art patrons in Renaissance Italy; the design is derived from prints exported to Europe.
            </li>
            <li>The war scene is more suited for a grander room of political importance
            </li>
            <li>The war scene depicts the contemporary event of the Great Turkish War; a Dutch Print was used for inspiration
            </li>
            <li>The war scene illustrates a scene of Hapsburg's power
            </li>
            <li>Lacquer-style imported works from Japan influenced the decorative floral elements and the landscape motifs
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
