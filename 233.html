      <ul>
        <li>Form
          <ul>
            <li>This is a combination of collage elements and abstract expressionist brushwork
            </li>
            <li>Newspaper clippings and images of conquest are placed over a large dominant canoe
            </li>
            <li>The red paint is symbolic of shedding of American Indian blood
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>The array of objects sardonically represents Indian culture in the eyes of Europeans: sport teams, Indian-style knickknacks such as toy tomahawks, dolls, and arrows
            </li>
            <li>A large canoe floats over the scene
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>Jaune Quick-to-See Smith is a member of the Salish and Kootenai American Indian tribes of the Flathead Nation
            </li>
            <li>The work was meant as the “Quincentenary Non-Celebration” of European occupation of North America
            </li>
            <li>American Indian social issues caused by European occupation are stressed: poverty, unemployment, disease, alcoholism
            </li>
            <li>Title Trade references events in American Indian History such as Manhattan being sold to the Dutch in 1626 for $24. Even if this story is apocryphal, it does highlight a history of “trade” in which Indians have been taken advantage of.
