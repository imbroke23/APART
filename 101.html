  <h1>101. The swing. Jean-Honore Fragonard. 1767 CE. Oil on canvas. 
  </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Form
      <ul>
        <li>Pastel palette; light brushwork
        </li>
        <li>Figures are small in a dominant garden-like setting
        </li>
        <li>Use of atmospheric perspective
        </li>
        <li>Puffy clouds; rich vegetation; abundant flowers; sinuous curves
        </li>
        <li>Symbolically a dreamlike setting
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Patronage and Content
      <ul>
        <li>Commissioned by an unnamed “gentleman of the Court:’’ a painting of his young mistress on a swing; in an early version, a bishop is pushing the swing with the gentleman admiring his mistress’s legs from below
        </li>
        <li>In the finished painting, the older man is no longer a priest, a barking dog has been added, and Falconet’s sculpture of Menacing Love comments on the story
        </li>
        <li>The patron in the lower left looks up the skirt of a young lady who swings flirtatiously, boldly kicking off her shoe at a sculpture
        </li>
        <li>The dog in the lower right corner, generally seen as a symbol of fidelity, barks in disapproval at the scene before him
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Context
      <ul>
        <li>Fragonard answers the libertine intentions of his patron by painting in the Rococo style
        </li>
        <li>Fragonard often used different styles at the same time, and he seems to have seen the Rococo as particularly appropriate for an erotic scene
        </li>
        <li>An intriguing painting; the patron hides in a bower; the garden sculpture of Menacing Love asks the lady to be discreet and may be a symbol for the secret hiding of the patron
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
