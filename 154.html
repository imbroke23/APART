      <ul>
        <li>Form
          <ul>
            <li>The top ledge houses supplies in a storage area; cool and dry area out of the way; accessible only by ladder
            </li>
            <li>Each family received one room in the dwelling.
            </li>
            <li>Plaza placed in front of the abode structure; kivas face the plaza

        </li>
        <li>Function
          <ul>
            <li>The pueblo was built into the sides of a cliff, housed about one hundred people
            </li>
            <li>Clans moved together for mutual support and defense
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>Farming done on the plateau above the pueblo; everything has to be imported into the structure; water seeped through the sandstone and collected in trenches near the rear of the structure
            </li>
            <li>Low winter sun penetrated the pueblo; high summer sun did not enter the interior and therefore it stayed relatively cool
            </li>
            <li>Inhabited for two hundred years; probably abandoned when the water source dried up.
            </li>
