              </li>
              <li>From the river sie, the building resembles a boat, referencing Bilbao’s past as a shipping and commercial center

              </li>
              <li>Fixing clips make a shallow dent in the titanium surface; it produces an effect of having a shimmering surface that changes according to atmospheric conditions
              </li>
              <li>Curvilinear forms evoke the architecture of Borromini and the Italian Baroque in general.
