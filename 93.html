      <h1>Name: 093. The Palace of versailles. Versailles, France. Louis Le Vau and Jules Hardouin-Mansart (Architects). Begun 1669 CE Masonry, stone, wood, iron, and gold leaf (architecture); marble and bronze (sculpture); Gardens. </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Function
            <ul>
              <li>This is the palace of King Louis XIV and subsequent kings and their courts
              </li>
              <li>The palace expresses the idea of the absolute monarch; the massive scale of the project is indicative of the massive power of the king
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>Louis XIV reorganized and remodeled an existing hunting lodge into an elaborate palace.
              </li>
              <li>The center of the building is Louis XIV’s bedroom, or audience chamber, from which all aspects of the design radiate like rays from the sun(hence Louis’ sobriquet the Sun King)
              </li>
              <li>The building is centered in a vast garden and town complex that radiated from it
              </li>
              <li>There is a subdued exterior decoration on the facade; the undulation of projecting members is understated.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Hall of Mirrors

            <ul>
              <img src="93b.jpeg" alt="PUT ALT ID HERE">

              <li>240 feet long, facing the garden facade
              </li>
              <li>Barrel-vaulted painted ceiling(paintings stress the military victories of Louis XIV; rooms that flank the Hall of Mirrors are thematically related, one of Peace and the other of War)              </li>
              <li>Light comes in from one side and ricochets off large panes of glass, the largest that could be made at the time
              </li>
              <li>This is an example of a use of flickering light in an architectural setting
              </li>
              <li>Mirrors were among the most expensive items manufactured in the seventeenth century–the Hall of Mirrors is an extravagant display of wealth.
              </li>
              <li>Mirrors were made exclusively in Venice at the time; workers had to be imported from Venice to make the mirror, which conformed to the dictates that the decorations at Versailles had to be made in France.
              </li>
              <li>Hall of Mirrors used for court and state functions: embassies, births, and marriages were celebrated in this room.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Subsequent History
            <ul>
              <li>Used by Bismarck to declare William I as German emperor after the defeat of the Franco-Prussian War in 1871
              </li>
              <li>Used reciprocally by the French after the defeat of the Germans in WWI to sign the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.

              <img src="93c.jpeg" alt="PUT ALT ID HERE">

              <li>Classically and harmoniously arranged
              </li>
              <li>Formal gardens near the palace; more wooded and less elaborate plantings farther from the palace
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>A mile-long canal crossed by another canal forms the main axis of the gardens; linked to the rising sun over the palace
              </li>
              <li>Only the fountains near the palace were turned on all the time; others were turned on only when the king progressed through the gardens.
