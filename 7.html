    <p>--Though we do not understand the function that these played in China, we see that there is a great deal of regularity and specificity
        - They are most definitely symbols the uniformity, clarity, and intentionality means that they must have been an important part of this culture.
        -The effort in order to make one of these is tremendous, you cannot simply carve it with stone or metal. Jade is an extremely hard material, which means that an even harder material is needed to cut it. Which makes the intricate designs and lines on these so much more impressive.
