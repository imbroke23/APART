        <h1>125. Mont Sainte-Victoire. Paul Cezanne. 1902-1904 CE oil on canvas. 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>Used perspective through juxtaposing forward warm colors with receding cool colors
              </li>
              <li>Cezanne had contempt for flat painting; wanted rounded and firm objects, but ones that were geometric constructions made from splashes of undiluted color.
              </li>
              <li>Not a momentary glimpse of atmosphere, as in the Impressionists, but a solid and firmly constructed mountain and foreground
              </li>
              <li>The landscape is seen from an elevation
              </li>
              <li>Cezanneâ€™s landscapes rarely contain humans
              </li>
              <li>Three horizontal sections divide the painting, connected by a complex series of diagonals that bring your eye back
              </li>
              <li>The viewer is invited to look at space, but not enter
              </li>
              <li>Cezanne allows blank parts of the canvas to shine through
              </li>
              <li>Broad brushstrokes dominate the painted surface
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>One of 11 canvases of this view near his studio in Aix in the south of France;the series dominates Cezanne's mature period.
              </li>
              <li>Not the countryside of Impressionism; more interested in geometric forms rather than dappled effects of light.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
