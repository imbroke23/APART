      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Masculine modeling of forms
        -Bold, direct, powerful narrative expression
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>-Michelangelo chose a complicated arrangement of figures for the ceiling, which broadly illustrates the first few chapters of Genesis in nine scenes, with accompanying Old Testament figures and antique sibyls–many based ib antique sculptures; the Old Testament figures antique sibyls foretell the coming of Christ, and they express a spirit of Neoplatonism,
        -The grand and massive figures are meant to be seen from a distance, but also echo the grandeur of the Biblical narrative
        -300 figures on the ceiling, with no two in the same pose; a tribute to Michelangelo’s lifelong preoccupation with the male nude in motion
        -Enormous variety of expression
        -Painted cornices frame groupings of figures in a highly organized way
        -Many figures are done for artistic expression rather than to enhance the narrative; the ignudi, for example
        </p>
  
      <h2>Function</h2>
      <p>-Function of the chapel: the place where new popes are elected and where papal services take place.
        -Name derives from Pope Sixtus IV, who was the patron of the building’s redesign between 1473 and 1481
        </p>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>-Sistine Chapel was erected in 1472 and painted by quattrocento masters, including Botticelli, Perugino, and Michelangelo’s teacher, Ghirlandaio; Michelangelo’s ceiling was added to these.
        -Quattrocento paintings are of the life of Christ and the life of Moses; Michelangelo needed a different topic for the ceiling; he chose the cosmic theme of creation
        -Michelangelo’s paintings are painted over the window level of the chapel as well as the ceiling
        -The chapel is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, as such the central panel on the ceiling depicts Eve, the archetype of Mary, who, according to tradition, began the redemption necessitated by the sin of Eve and Adam
        -Acorns, a motif on the ceiling, were inspired by the crest of the chapel's patron, Pope Julius II
