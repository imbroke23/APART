        <h1>The Gates. New York City, US. Christo and Jeanne-Claude. 1979-2005 CE Mixed- media Installation. 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>Installation of 7,503 “gates” of free-hanging saffron-colored fabric panels
              </li>
              <li>The installation framed all the pathways in Central Park in New York City, a nineteenth-century park originally designed by Olmsted and Vaux
              </li>
              <li>The work was mounted in the winter so the colors would have maximum impact; the trees were bare and the gates easily visible
              </li>
              <li>The 16-foot-tall gates friend a continuous river of color
              </li>
              <li>The work covered 23 miles of footpaths
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Christo is Bulgarian-born; Jean-Claude was of French descent, born in Morocco
              </li>
              <li>The work was put on hold for many years, but installed a few years after 9/11
              </li>
              <li>Temporary installation: 16 days
              </li>
              <li>After the exhibition closed, the materials were recycled
              </li>
              <li>Spectators walked through the gates to see ever-changing views of the park
              </li>
            </ul>
