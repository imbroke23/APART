      <h1>209. Taj Mahal. Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. Masons, marble workers, mosaicists, and decorators working under the supervision of Ustad Ahmad Lahori, architect of the emperor/ 1632-1653 CE Stone masonry and marble with inlay of precious and semiprecious stones, gardens. 
      </h1>
      <p>-Patron: 5th ruler of Mughal Dynasty Shah Jahan 
       - Created as a permanent resting places for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died due to complications during the birth of their fourteenth child
       - Result of his efforts and resources was the creation of what was called the “Luminous Tomb” in contemporary Mughal texts, which is what the world knows today as the Taj Mahal.  
       -Agra, India was first conquered by Muslim invaders in the eleventh century- also where Shah Jahan took the throne in 1628
-The city became a flourishing area of trade during Shah Jahan’s rule
-Situated on the banks of the Yamuna River so easy access to water
-Agra had the reputation as a “riverfront garden city” with meticulously planned gardens and lush vegetation in the sixteenth century
-Taj Mahal situated above the Yamuna River
-Entry to the Taj Mahal complex is via the forecourt (which in the sixteenth century housed shops) and through a monumental gate of inlaid and highly decorated red sandstone
-Once pass through gate, see the Taj aligned along a long water channel
-Set majestically on a raised platform on the north end
-The rectangular complex runs roughly 1860 feet on the north-south axis, and 1000 feet on the east-west axis
-Earlier Mughal buildings primarily constructed of red sandstone
-Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones
-Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement
-The white-marble mausoleum flanked on either side by identical buildings in red sandstone- one serves as a mosque, but function of the other is unknown- may have been included to create sense of architectural balance.  
-The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal.
-Large, white marble structure standing on a square  plinth- consists of a symmetrical building with an *iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial
-Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin
-Marble structure is topped by a bulbous dome and surrounded by four minarets of equal height
-Minarets are ornamental, not functional- not used to call Muslims to prayer- use of minarets here reinforces the idea that Mughal architecture focused on structural balance and harmony.

      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Symmetrical harmony of design
        -Typical Islamic feature of one large central arch flanked by 2 smaller arches
        -Square plan with chamfered corners
        -Onion-shaped dome rises from the facade
        -Intricate floral and geometric inlays of colored stone
        -Minarets act like a picture frame, directing the eye of the viewer and sheltering the monument
        -Texts from the Qu’ran cover surface
        -Motifs of flowering plants, carved into the walls of the structure, may have been inspired by engravings in European herbals.</p>
