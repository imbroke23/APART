        <h1>151. Spiral Jetty. Great Salt Lake, Utah. US. Robert Smithson. 1970 CE Earthwork: mud, precipitated salt crystals, rocks, and water coil. 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>A coil of rock placed in a part of the Great Salt Lake that is in an extremely remote and inaccessible area
              </li>
              <li>The artist liked the site because of the blood-red color of the water, which is due to the presence of bacteria and algae that live in the high-salt content
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Material
            <ul>
              <li>The artist used a tractor to move basalt from the adjacent hillside to create the jetty
              </li>
    
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Upon walking on the jetty, the twisting and curling path changes the viewerâ€™s view from every angle
              </li>
              <li>A jetty is usually a pier extending into the water; here it is transformed into a curl of rocks sitting silently in a vast, empty wilderness
              </li>
              <li>The work reflects emerging views of the environmental movement; Earth Day was inaugurated in 1970
              </li>
              <li>Smithson wanted nature to have its effect on the jetty
              </li>
            </ul>
