          <li>Each board's design is unique and represents the divine revelations of a spirit medium expressed in sculptural form
          </li>
          <li>Memory boards are controlled by the Mbudye, a council of men and women who interpret the political and historical aspects of Luba society.
          </li>
          <li>Zoomorphic elements represented by the turtle, an animal that lives on both land and water; the dual nature of the turtle is a metaphor for the Luba peopleś political organization as founded by two distinctly opposed embodiments of power: Kongolo Mwamba, avatar of all excess and tyranny, and Mbidi Kiluwe, sophisticated cultural hero introduced royal culture to the Luba people
