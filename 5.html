        -Stylized running dogs with long narrow bodies right below the top frieze
        -Oversized horns
        -Abstract stylized motif(does not look like pictures of natural objects)

    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>Context</p>
    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>--Up for debate whether a potter’s wheel was used or not. Some argue that it does not have the perfection that a wheel gives you, while others say it could have been a slow wheel.
        -The long necks of the birds highlight the verticality of the vessel and the roundness of the horns highlight the cylindrical shape of the vessel.
        -The motif inside of the goat's horns is hypothesized to be the artist's signature or a topographical/clan symbol that identifies the vase and owner.
