      <h1>191.The Ardabil Carpet. Maqsud of Kashan. 1539- 1540 CE Silk and wool.
      </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Wool carpet, woven by ten people, probably men; although women also did weaving in this period
        -The importance of the location and the size of the project indicate that men were entrusted with its execution.</p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--The medallion in the center of the carpet may represent the inside of a dome with 16 pendants
        -Mosque lamps hang from two of the pendants; because one lamp is smaller than the other, the lamp is placed further away so that appears the same size as the smaller one; some suggest that this is a deliberate flaw to reflect that God alone is perfect.
        -Inscription: “Except for thy threshold, there is no refuge for men in all the world. Except for Kashani,” and the date, 946, in the Muslim calendar
        -World’s oldest dated carpet
        </p>
  
      <h2>Function</h2>
      <p>-Prayer carpet used at a pilgrimage site of a Sulfi saint
        -Huge carpet, one of a matching pair, from the funerary mosque of Shkayik Aafial-Din; probably made when the shrine was enlarged. The companion carpet is in the L.A. country museum of art.</p>

      <h2>Additional Information</h2>
