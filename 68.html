      </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Meticulous handling of oil paint; great concentration of minute details.
        -Linear perspective, but upturned ground plane and two horizon lines unlike contemporary Italian Renaissance art
        -Great care is taken in rendering elements of a contemporary Flemish bedroom
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--Symbolism of weddings
        –The custom of burning a cable on the first night of a wedding
        –Shoes are cast off, indicating that the couple is standing on holy ground.
        –The groom is in a promising pose
        –The dog symbolizes fidelity
        </p>
        <p>-Two witnesses in the convex mirror; perhaps the artist himself. Since the inscription reads “Jan van Eyck was here 1434”
          -The woman pulls up her dress to symbolize childbirth, although most likely she is not pregnant; the gesture may simply be a fashion of the time
          -The Statue of Saint Margaret, patron saint of childbirth, appears on the bedpost
          -The man is standing near the windows, symbolizing his role as someone who makes his way in the outside world; the woman appears further in the room to emphasize her role as a homemaker.
          -Wealth is displayed in the opulent furnishings, the elaborate clothing, and the importing of fresh oranges from southern Europe
          </p>
