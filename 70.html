      <h1>070. Palazzo Rucellai. Florence, Italy. Leon Battista Alberti (architect). c. 1450 CE Sone, masonry. </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Three horizontal floors separated by a strongly articulated string course; each floor is shorter than the one below.
        -Pilasters rise vertically and divide the spaces into squarish shapes
        -AN emphasized cornice caps the building
        -Square windows on the first floor; windows with mullions on the second and third floors
        -Rejects rustication of earlier Renaissance palaces; used beveled masonry joints instead
        -Benches on the lower level connect the palazzo with the city
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--The articulation of the three stories links the building to the Colosseum levels, which have arches framed by columns: the first-floor pilasters are Tuscan; the second is Alberti’s own invention; the third is corinthian.
        -Original building:
        —Five bays on the left, with a central food
        —Second doorway bay and right bay added later
        —Eighth bay fragmentary: owners of the house next door refused to sell, and the Palazzo Rucellai never expanded.
        </p>
  
      <h2>Function</h2>
      <p>-City residence of the Rucellai family
        -The building format expresses classical humanist ideals for a residence: the bottom floor was used for business; the family received guests on the second floor; the family’s private quarters were on the third floor; the hidden fourth floor was for servants
