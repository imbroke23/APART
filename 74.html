      <h1>074. Adam and Eve. Albrecht Durer.  1504 CE Engraving. 
      </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Influenced by classical sculpture; Adam looks like the Apollo Belvedere, and Eve looks like Medici Venus
        -Italian massing of forms, which he learned from his Italian trips
        -Ideal image of humans before the Fall of Man
        -Contrapposto of figures from the Italian Renaissance, in turn also based on classical Greek art
        -Northern European devotion to detail
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--Four humors are represented in the animals: cat(angry), rabbit(energetic), elk(melancholic), ox(lethargic); the four humors were kept in balance before the Fall of Man the humors fell out of balance after the successful temptation of the serpent
        -The mouse represents Satan
        -The parrot is a symbol of cleverness
        -Adam tries to dissuade Eve; he grasps the mountain ash, a tree from which snakes recoil.
        
        -Prominent placement of the artistâ€™s signature indicates the rising status of his occupation
