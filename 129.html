        <h1>129.  The Kiss. Constantin Brancusi. Original 1907-1908 CE Stone. 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>Symbolic, almost Cubist rendering of the male and female bodies
              </li>
              <li>Simplified carving
              </li>
              <li>Intertwined and enveloped figures
              </li>
              <li>Interlocked forms; fused bodies
              </li>
              <li>Two eyes become one, almost Cyclops-like
              </li>
              <li>Rough surface contributes to a feeling of naturalism; this is an artistic break from the high polish effect of past sculpture
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Patronage
            <ul>
              <li>Requested by John Quinn, Brancusi’s patron in New York, who admired the small plaster version of The Kiss in the collection of the artist Walter Pach
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Brancusi worked in Rodin’s studio
              </li>
              <li>This is the fourth stone version of this subject:
              <ul>
                <li>First version was one of Brancusi’s earliest efforts at stone carving
                </li>
                <li>Second version was exhibited at the Armory Show
                </li>
                <li>Third version used as a tombstone in Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris over the body of a suicide victim: a young Russian anarchist
                <ul>
                  <li>The artist was asked by a friend of the deceased, who had hilted her, for a marker for her grace
                  </li>
                  <li>The artist said take what you want; he took this work
                  </li>
                </ul></li>
              </ul></li>
              <li>There may be many more undocumented versions
              </li>
  
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
