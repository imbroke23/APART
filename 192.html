      </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Three umbrellas at the top represent Buddha, Buddha’s law, and monastic orders
        -A railing at the crest of the mount surrounds the umbrellas, symbolically representing a sacred tree.
        -Double stairway at the south end leads from the base to the drum, where there is a walkway for circumambulation.
        -Originally painted white.
        -Hemispherical dome is a replication of the dome of heaven. Seated Buddha from the second level from the Later Gupta period.
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--Donors’ names are carved into the monument: 600 inscriptions reveal the project was funded by women as well as men, common people as well as monks.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Function</h2>
      <p>-Pilgrimage site
        -A Buddhist shrine, mound-shaped and faced with dressed stone containing the relics of the Buddha
        -The worshiper circumambulates the stupa clockwise along the base of the drums; circular motion suggests the endless cycle of birth and rebirth.
        </p>
      
      <h2>Additional Information</h2>
      <p>--Toranas:
        -Four toranas, or gateways, at cardinal points of the compass, grace the entrances
        -The orientation of the toranas and the direction of the ritualistic circumambulation correspond with the direction of the sun’s course: from sunrise to the zenith, sunset, and nadir
        -Torona: richly carved scenes on the architraves.
        -Buddha does not appear himself but is symbolized by an empty throne or a tree under which he meditated
        -Some of these reliefs may also represent the sacred site where Shakyamuni Buddha visited or taught others about the jataka stories or past lives of the Buddha
        -Horror vacui of composition
        -High-Relief sculpture
        -Pre-Buddhist Yakshi figures symbolize fertility.
