        <h1>088.  San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane. Rome, Italy. Francesco Borromini (architect). 1638- 1646 CE Stone and Stucco
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>-Named because it is on a street intersection in Rome with four fountains.
              </li>
              <li>-Exterior
              <ul>
                <li>Unusually small site
                </li>
                <li>The building is designed with alternating convex and concave pattern and undulating volumes in both the ground plan and on the facade.
                </li>
                <li>The facade is higher than the rest of the building
                </li>
              </ul></li>
              <li>Interior
                <ul>  
                  <li>The interior side chapels merge into a central space
                  </li>
                  <li>The interior dome is oval shaped and coffered
                  </li>
                  <li>The dome has an interconnection of different shapes that fit together seamlessly; they illustrate the Baroque admiration for multiplicity that resolves into a unified space
                  </li>
                  <li>The walls are treated sculpturally; Baroque drama and complexity is shown
                  </li>
                  <li>Borromini worked in shades of white, avoiding the colors ussed in many other Baroque buildings.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Function
            <ul>
              <li>It was built as part of a complex of monastic buildings for the Spanish Trinitarians, an order of religion dedicated to freeing Christian Slaves.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>Sculptures of Trinitarian saints are placed on the facade
              </li>
              <li>Medallion on facade once held a fresco of the Trinity.
              </li>
              <li>Borromini worked on the building for free, giving him more artistic license
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
