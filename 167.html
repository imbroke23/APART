        <li>Form 
          <ul>
            <li>Walls: 800 feet long, 32 feet tall; 17 feet thick at base
            </li>
            <li>Walls slope inward toward the top; made of exfoliated granite blocks
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Function
          <ul>
            <li>Zimbabwe was a prosperous trading center and royal complex; items from as far away as Persia and China have been found
            </li>
            <li>Stone enclosure was probably a royal residence
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>Zimbabwe derives from a Shona term meaning “venerated houses” or “houses of stone.”
            </li>
            <li>Internal and external passageways are tightly bounded, narrow, and long; occupants are forced to walk in single file, paralleling experiences in the African bush
            </li>
            <li>Abandoned in the fifteenth century probably because the surrounding area could no longer supply food and there was extensive deforestation.
            </li>
          </ul>
