        <h1>133. Self-Portrait as a Soldier. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. 1915 CE. Oil on canvas. 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>Nightmarish quality
              </li>
              <li>Colors are nonrepresentational but symbolic, chosen to provide a jarring impact
              </li>
              <li>Expressive quality of horrified facial features and grim surroundings
              </li>
              <li>Tilted perspective moves things closer to the picture plane.
              </li>
              <li>Main character has a drawn face with a cigarette hanging loosely from his lips.
              </li>
              <li>The eyes are unseeing and empty; without pupils; the iris reflects the blue of his uniform.
              </li>
              <li>The bloody stump of a hand represents losses in war, loss of the artist’s ability to paint, his creativity, his artistic vision, and his inspiration
              </li>
              <li>Sharp angular lines reinforce a sense of violence and anxiety
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Kirchner became an ‘’unwilling volunteer,’” a driver in the artillery in WWI, to avoid being drafted into the infantry
              </li>
              <li>He is wearing the uniform of his field artillery regiment
              </li>
              <li>He was declared unfit for service; he had lung problems and weakness and suffered a mental breakdown–there is a scholarly debate as to whether he faked these ailments to avoid service.
              </li>
              <li>This self-portrait was painted during a recuperation period
              </li>
              <li>His life was plagued by drug abuse, alcoholism, and then paralysis
              </li>
              <li>The artist feared that war would destroy his creative powers
              </li>
            </ul>
