          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>May have been in response to a trip in Morocco, where Matisse noted how the local population would daydream for hours, gazing into goldfish bowls. Form, Color, and subject matter were inspired by this trip
              </li>
              <li>Admired the relaxed and contemplative lifestyle of the Moroccans, which symbolized a meditative state of mind and a sense of paradise lost to Europeans.
              </li>
              <li>May have been influenced by the decorative quality of Asian art and diverse cultures from North Africa.
