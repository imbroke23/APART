    <h1>078. Entombment of Christ. Jacopo da Pontormo. 1525- 1528 CE Oil on wood. 
    </h1>

    <h2>Form</h2>
    <p>-Anticlassical composition
        -Linear bodies twisting around one another
        -In the center of the circular composition is a grouping of hands
        -Hands seem disembodied
        -No ground line for many figures; what is Mary sitting on?
        -Elongation of bodies
        -Some androgynous figures
        -No weeping, just yearning
        -High-keyed colors, perhaps taking into account the darkness of the chapel is placed in.
        </p>
        
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>--The painting is called Entombment of Christ, although there is no tomb, just carrying of Jesusâ€™s lifeless body
        -It is placed over the altar of a family chapel near the right from the entrance of Santa Felicita in Florence
        -The composition and Mannerist style may reflect the instability in European politics brought on by the Protestant Reformation.
        -There is a self-portrait on the extreme right of the painting
        </p>
