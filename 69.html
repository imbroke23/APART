      <h1>069. David. Donatello. c. 1440- 1460 CE Bronze. 
      </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-First large bronze nude since antiquity
        -Exaggerated contrapposto of the body
        -Sleekness of the black bronze adds to the femininity of the work
        -Androynous figure; homoerotic overtones
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--The work depicts the moment after David slays the Philistine Goliath with a rock from a slingshot; David then decapitates Goliath with his own sword
        -David contemplates his victory over Goliath, whose head is at his feet; David’s head is lowered to suggest humility
        -Laurel on David’s hat indicates he was a poet; the hat is a foppish Renaissance design
        </p>
  
      <h2>Function</h2>
      <p>-Life-size work, probably meant to be housed in the Medici palace courtyard; not for public viewing
      </p>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>-David symbolizes Florence taking on larger forces with ease; perhaps Goliath would have been equated with the Duke of Milan
        -Nothing is known of its commission or patron, but it was placed in the courtyard of the Medici Palace in Florence
        -Modern theory alleges that this is a figure of Mercury and that the decapitated head is of Argo; Mercury is the patron of the arts and merchants, and therefore an appropriate symbol for the Medici.
