        <h1>114. Nadar Raising Photography to the Height of Art. Honore Daumier. 1862 CE Lithograph. 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>Nadar often took his balloon over Paris to photograph scenes from above
              </li>
              <li>Daumier was a satiric artist who portrayed political and social events with a critical eye
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Function
            <ul>
              <li>Originally appeared in a journal, Le Boulevard, as a mass-produced lithograph
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>The print satirizes the claims that photography can be a “high art;” irony implied in title
              </li>
              <li>Nadar was famous for taking aerial photos of Paris beginning in 1858
              </li>
              <li>The work was executed after a court decision in 1862 that determined that photographs could be considered works of art; this is Daumier’s commentary
              </li>
              <li>Presents Nadar as a silly photographer; in his excitement to get a daring shot he almost falls out of his balloon and loses his hat
              </li>
              <li>Photography used as a military tool: Nadar’s balloon reused in the 1870 siege of Paris
              </li>
              <li>Every building has the word “Photographie” on it; foreshadows modern surveillance photographs, drones with cameras, Google earth
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
