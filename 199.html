      <h1>199. Angkor, The temple of Angkor Wat, and the city of Angkor thom, Cambodia. Hindu, Angkor Dynasty, c. 800-1400 CE Stone masonry, sandstone. </h1>
      <p>-Largest religious monument in the world 
        -Site measures approximately 155 square miles
        -Originally built as Hindu temple for the Khmer Empire- dediciated to Vishnu
        -Built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in early 12th century as his state temple and eventual mausoleum
        -Gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple toward the end of the 12th century
        -Best-preserved temple at the site
        Combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the galleried temple
-Designed to represent Mount Meru, the home of the deva(s) (benevolent deity) in Hindu mythology
-A moat and an outer wall that is 2.2 mi long surround three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next
-At the center of the temple stands a *quincunx of towers. 
-Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this
-Oriented toward the West- WHY?
-Suryavarman II may have intended it to serve as his funerary temple. This idea supported by counter-clockwise direction of narrative reliefs (reverse of the normal order)- rituals take place in reverse order during Brahminic funeral services
-A container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the central tower
-Several other temples of Angkor depart from the typical eastern orientation- and suggests that Angkor Wat's alignment was due to its dedication to Vishnu, who was associated with the west.
