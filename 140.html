        <h1>140. The Two fridas. Frida Kahlo. 1939 CE Oil on canvas. 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>On the left: Kahlo is dressed as a Spanish lady in which lace, linking her to a European heritage
              </li>
              <li>On the right: Kahlo dressed as a Mexican peasant–the stiffness and provincial quality of Mexican folk art was a direct inspiration for the artist
              </li>
              <li>Behind is a barren landscape; two figures sit against a wildly active sky
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>There is a juxtaposition to two self-portraits
              </li>
              <li>Kahlo’s two hearts are joined together by veins that are cut by scissors at one end and lead to a portrait of her husband, artist Diego Rivera, at the other; painted at the time of their divorce
              </li>
              <li>The vein acts as an umbilical cord; symbolism: Rivera as both husband and son.
              </li>
              <li>Blood on her lap suggests many abortions and miscarriages; also, surgeries related to her health issues
              </li>
              <li>Kahlo rejected the label Surrealism for her artwork
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
