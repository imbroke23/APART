              </li>
              <li>The earliest names appear in the vortex and extend out to one end of the monument and begin again at the other end working toward the vortex; a symbolic circular association
              </li>

          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Maya Lin is an Ohio-born Chinese-American
              </li>
              <li>This was the winning design in an anonymous competition held to create a memorial on the mall in Washington, D.C.
              </li>
              <li>The work is not an overly political monument with a message, but a memorial to the deceased who sacrifice everything
              </li>
              <li>One arm of the monument points to the Lincoln Memorial, the other to the Washington Monument, placing itself central to key figures in American history
              </li>
              <li>It digs into the earth like a scar, a scar that heals but whose traces remain, a reflection of the impact of the war on the American consciousness.
              </li>
              <li>Initially strongly criticized by those who wanted a more traditional war monument; later, a figural grouping was placed nearby.
              </li>
              <li>Strongly influenced by the Minimalist movement
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
