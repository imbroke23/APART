      <ul>
        <li>Form
          <ul>
            <li>Black-on-black vessel
            </li>
            <li>Highly polished surface
            </li>
            <li>Contrasting shiny black and matte black finishes
            </li>
            <li>Exceptional symmetry; walls of even thickness; surfaces free of imperfections
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Function
          <ul>
            <li>Comes from the thousand-year-old tradition of pottery making in the Southwest
            </li>
            <li>Maria Martinez preferred making pots using a new technique that rendered a vessel lightweight, less hard, and not watertight, as traditional pots were; this kind of vessel reflected the market shift away from utilitarian vessels to decorative objects
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Technique
          <ul>
            <li>Used a mixture of clay and volcanic ash
            </li>
            <li>The surface was scraped to a smooth finish with a gourd tool and then polished with a stone
            </li>
            <li>Julian Martinez painted designs with a liquid clay that yielded a matte finish in contrast with the high shine of the pot itself
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>At the time of production, pueblos were in decline; modern life was replacing traditional life
            </li>
            <li>Artistâ€™s work sparked a revival of pueblo techniques
            </li>
            <li>Maria Martinez, the potter, developed and invented new shapes beyond the traditional pueblo forms
            </li>
            <li>Julian Martinez, the painter of the pots, revived the use of ancient mythic figures and designs on the pots
            </li>
            <li>Reflects an influence of Art Deco designs popular at the tie
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
