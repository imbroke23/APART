        Technique
        <ul>
          <li>The artist draws images with a greasy white pencil or soft pastel crayon on large pieces of black paper and then cuts the paper with a knife</li>
          <li>Images are then adhered to a gallery wall with wax</li>
          <li>The artist uses traditional silhouette forms</li>
          <li>Overhead projectors throw colored light onto the walls, ceilings, and floor</li>
          <li>Cast shadows of the viewers body mingle with the black paper images</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Context
        <ul>
          <li>Kara Walker is a California-born, New York–based, African-American artist</li>
          <li>The work explores themes of African-Americans in the antebellum South: a teenager holds a flag that resembles a colonial ship sail; one man has his leg cut off; a woman is carting for newborns</li>
          <li>The work explores how stereotypes and caricatures of African-Americans have been presented</li>
          <li>Inspired by an anonymous landscape called “Darkytown”; it was the artist’s invention to have the figures in rebellion</li>
          <li>This is not a recreation of a historical event, but a commentary on history as it has been presented in the past and present</li>
          <li>The viewer interacts with the work, walking around it, engaging in elements of it; the viewer is part of the history of the piece.</li>
