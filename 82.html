      <h1>Il Gesu, including Triumph of the Name of Jesus ceiling fresco. Rome, Italy. Giovanni Battista Gaulli, ceiling frescos (artist). Frescos and stucco figures 1676- 1679
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Form and Content
          <ul>
            <li>On the ceiling in the main nave of II Gesu, Rome
            </li>
            <li>In the center is the monogram of Jesus, IHS, in a brilliant sea of golden color
            </li>
            <li>Figures tumble below the name; some are carved in stucco and enhance the three-dimensional effect
            </li>
            <li>Some cast long shadows across the barrel vault
            </li>
            <li>Some painted figures are not stucco, but maintain a vibrant three-dimensional illusion.
            </li>
            <li>It is as if the ceiling were opened to the sky and the figures are spiraling around Jesus’s name
            </li>
            <li>Depicted in the center are holy men and women
            </li>
            <li>Around the rim are priests, soldiers, noblemen, and the Magi
            </li>
            <li>Allegories of avarice, simony, heresy, and vanity occupy the lowest registers
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Function
            <ul>
              <li>A Last Judgment scene, placed over the barrel vault of the nave; cf. Last Judgment scenes placed on the wall of the chapels
              </li>
              <li>Message to the faithful: the damned are cast into hell; the saved rise heavenward
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Inspired by Saint Paul’s epistle to the Philippians 2:10: “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.”</li>
              <li>There is the influence of Bernini’s dramatic emotionalism in the style; Gaulli was Bernini’s pupil.
