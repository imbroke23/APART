    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Content
    <ul>
      <li>Caves were not dwellings because prehistoric people led migratory lives following herds of animals; some evidence suggests that people sought shelter at the mouths of caves.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Function
    <ul>
      <li>Theories:
        <ul>
          <li>Traditional View: to ensure a successful hunt</li>
          <li>Ancestral Worship</li>
          <li>Shamanism: a religion based on the idea that the forces of nature can be contacted by shamans.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Context
    <ul>
      <li>A few teenage boys accidentally discovered the cave</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Additional Information
    <ul>
      <li>Natural products used to make paint: charcoal, iron ore, and plants</li>
      <li>Paint colors were bound with animal fat</li>
      <li>Lamps light the interior of the caves</li>
      <li>Flat rocks were used as palettes</li>
      <li>Evidence of scaffolding</li>
      <li>Walls were scraped flat(ish)</li>
      <li>2,000 figures in the cave: animals, humans, and abstract symbols in the chamber. However, no landscape or vegetation is shown.</li>
      <li>Bodies of the bulls are shown in profile view with all 4 legs present.</li>
      <li>Bull's heads are shown in frontal view of their horns</li>
      <li>Because a full profile would not show the whole animal, artists wanted to show the whole anatomy by drawing some in profile and some in frontal.</li>
      <li>Twisted perspective: bodies in profile while horns are in frontal</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
