      <h1>179.  Reliquary figure (byeri). Fang peoples (southern Cameroon). c. 19th to 20th century C.E. Wood.
      </h1>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Form
          <ul>
            <li>Feet dangling over the rim, a gesture of protecting the contents
            </li>
            <li>Prominent belly button and genitals emphasize life; the prayerful gesture and somber look emphasize death
            </li>
            <li>Emphasis on the head and the tubular nature of the body
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Function
          <ul>
            <li>Such figures were placed on top of cylinder-like containers made of bark that held skulls and other bones of important clan leaders
            </li>
            <li>The reliquary figure guards the head box against the gaze of women or young boys
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>The surfaces were ritually rubbed with oils to add luster and protect against insects
            </li>
            <li>Byeri figures are composed of characteristics the Fang people place a high value on: tranquility, introspection, and vitality.
            </li>
            <li>The Fang people were nomadic; these figures were made to be portable.
            </li>
            <li>The abstraction of the human body is an attraction for the early-twentieth-century artists.
            </li>
