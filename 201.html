          <li>Form and Content
            <ul>
              <li>Very compelx landscape </li>
              <li>Different brushstrokes describe different kinds of trees: coniferous, deciduous, etc </li>
              <li>The long waterfall on the right is balanced by a mountain on the left; the waterfall accents the height of the mountain; embodying the essence of a place rather than likeness</li>
              <li>Not a pure landscape: donkeys laden with firewood are driven by two men; a small temple appears in the forest; people seen as small and insignificant in a vast natural world </li>
              <li>Mists, created by ink washes, silhoutte the roof of the temple </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Function
            <ul>
              <li>Hanging scroll, meant to be studied and appreciated, not hung permanently </li>
    
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>context
            <ul>
              <li>The artist isolated himself away from civilization to be with nature and to study for his landscape; this reflects a Daoist philosophy</li>
              <li>The work contains elements of Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism</li>
              <li>This might be the artist's only surviving work; his signature is hidden in the bushes on the lower right</li>
            </ul>
