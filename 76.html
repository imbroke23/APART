      <h1>076. School of Athens. Raphael. 1509- 1511 CE. Frescos. 
      </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Open, clear light uniformly spread throughout the composition.
        -Nobility and monumentality of forms parallel the greatness of the figures represented; figures gesture to indicate their philosophical thought
        -Raphel’s overall composition was influenced by Leonardo’s Last Supper
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--Opposite this work is a Raphael painting called La Disputa, based on religion; religious books were placed below; parallels drawn between the two themes expressed in the paintings
        -To the left of Philosophy is Apollo and the Muses on Parnassus, referencing literature.
        -The building depicted in the background might reflect Bramante’s plan for Saint Peter’s; Bramante appears as the bald Euclid in the lower right
        -In the center are the 2 greatest figures in ancient Greek thought: Plato on the left pointing up, and Aristotle pointing out. Their gestures reflect their philosophies.
        -On the left are those interested in the ideal(Followers of Plato); on the right, those interested in the practical(followers of Aristotle)
        -Raphael is on the extreme right with a black hat.
        -Michelangelo, resting on the stone block writing a poem, represents the philosopher Heraclitus; the figure was added later and was not part of the original composition.
        </p>
  
      <h2>Function</h2>
      <p>-Commissioned by Pope Julies II to decorate his library.
        -This is one painting in a complex program of works that illustrates the vastness and variety of the papal library
        -Painting was originally called Philosophy because the pope’s philosophy books were meant to be housed on shelving below
