        <ul>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>The story of life, read right to left
              </li>
              <li>Right: birth, infant, and three adults–the beginning of life
              </li>
              <li>Center: mid life; picking of the fruit of the world
              </li>
              <li>Left: death; the old woman seems resigned
              </li>
              <li>The blue idol with arms half-raised represents “The Beyond”
              </li>
              <li>The figures in foreground represent Tahiti and an Eden-like paradise; background figures are anguished, darkened figures
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Title of the painting poses more questions than it answers
              </li>
              <li>Gauguin thought the painting was a summation of his artistic and personal expression. Painted during his second stay in Tahiti between 1895-1901
              </li>
              <li>Gauguin suffered from poor health and poverty, obsessed by thoughts of death
              </li>
              <li>He learned of the death of his daughter, Aline, in April 1897 and was deeply shaken; he was determined to commit suicide and have this painting be his artistic last will and testament
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Influences
            <ul>
