        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>The work illustrates the collective African-American experience; therefore, there is little individuality in the figures
              </li>
              <li>Forms hover in larger spaces
              </li>
              <li>Angularity of forms
              </li>
              <li>Tilted tabletops show the surface of the table
              </li>
              <li>Flat, simple shapes
              </li>
              <li>Unmodulated colors
              </li>
              <Li>Collective unity achieved by painting one color across many panels before going on to the next door; overall color unity in the series unites each painting
              </Li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>This scene involves a public restaurant in the North; segregation emphasized by the yellow poles that zigzag down the center
              </li>
              <li>Whites appear haughty and self-engrossed
              </li>
              <li>African-Americans appear faceless; forms reveal their bodies and personalities
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>One of a series of 60 paintings that depicts the migration of African-Americans from the rural South to the urban North and WWI
              </li>
              <li>Negroes escaping the economic privation of the South
              </li>
              <li>Narrative painting in an era of increased abstraction
              </li>
              <li>Cinematic movement of views of panels: some horizontal and others vertical
              </li>
              <li>Influenced by the Italian masters of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; used tempera paint
              </li>
              <li>The Phillps Collections in Washington, DC., and the Museum of Modern Art in New York bought the collection and it was split. Phillips took the odd-numbered paintings; the Museum of Modern Art has the even-numbered ones.
