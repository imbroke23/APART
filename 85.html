      <h1>Calling of Saint Matthew. Caravaggio. c. 1597- 1601 CE Oil on canvas. </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Function and Patronage
          <ul>
            <li>One of three paintings illustrating the life of Saint Mathew in a chapel dedicated to him by the Contarelli family
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      <li>Form
        <ul>
          <li>Diagonal shaft of light points directly to Saint Matthew, who points himself as if unsure that Christ would select him
          </li>
          <li>Light coming in from two sources on the right creates a tenebroso effect on the figures
          </li>
          <li>Christ’s pose is the inverse of Adam’s on the Sistine Chapel
          </li>
          <li>Only a light suggestion of halo on Christ’s head indicates sanctity of the scene.
          </li>
          <li>
            Foppishly dressed figures wear cutting-edge Baroque fashion
          </li>
          <li>Figures placed on a shallow stage
          </li>
          <li>Sensual figures, everyday people
          </li>
          <li>Naturalist approach to the Baroque
          </li>
        
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Context
        <ul>
          <li>Matthew was a tax collector; hence he is seated at a table with coins being counted.
          </li>
          <li>Story taken from Matthew 9:9: “As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. ‘Follow me,’ he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.”
          </li>
          <li>Two figures on the left are so concerned with counting the money they do not even notice Christ’s arrival; symbolically their inattention to Christ deprives them of the opportunity he offers: eternal life.
          </li>
          <li>Jesuit influence on Counter-Reformation Baroque art; the sensual or physical expression of faith as expressed in Saint Ignatius’s Spiritual Exercises
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
