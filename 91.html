      <h1> Las Meninas. Diego Velazquez. c. 1656 CE Oil on canvas. </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Content
          <ul>
            <li>Portrait of the artist in his studio at work; he steps back from his very large canvas and looks at the viewer
            </li>
            <li>Central is the Infanta Margharita of Spain with her meninas, a dog, a dwarf, and a midget. Behind are two chaperones in half-shadow. In the doorway is perhaps Jose Nieto, who was head of the queen’s tapestry works
            </li>
            <li>The king and queen appear in a mirror. But what is the mirror reflecting?
              <ul>
                <li>Velaquez’s canvas?
                </li>
                <li>The king and queen perhaps standing in the viewer’s space–is this why people have turned around?
                </li>
                <li>Or is it reflecting a painting of the king and queen on the far wall of the room
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What is the painter painting?
              <ul>
                <li>The royal family?
                </li>
                <li>The Infanta?
                </li>
                <li>A painting of this painting?
                </li>
                <li>Us?
                </li>
                <li>Ultimately, there is no answer, which expresses the Baroque fascination with exploring reality.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Form
          <ul>
            <li>Alternating darks and lights draw the viewer deeper into the canvas; the mirror simultaneously reflects out into the viewer’s space
            </li>
            <li>Dappled effect of light on shimmering surfaces
            </li>
            <li>Painterly brushstrokes seen in the sleeves of the Infanta and the hands of the artist
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Function
          <ul>
          <li>
            Painting originally hung in King Philip IV’s study
          </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>Velaquez wears the cross of the Royal Order of Santiago, which elevated him to knighthood; this work seeks to establish painting as a noble occupation
            </li>
            <li>Paintings on the back wall depict Minerva, goddess of wisdom and patroness of the arts.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
