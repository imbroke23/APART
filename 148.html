        <ul>
          <li>Function and History

            <ul>
              <li>The artist originally featured the work as an uninvited participant in the 1966 Venice Biennale
              </li>
              <li>Fifteen hundred large, mirrored, plastic balls were placed on a lawn under a sign that said “Your Narcissism for Sale”
              </li>
              <li>The viewer is reflected seemingly into infinity in the mirrored surfaces
              </li>
              <li>The artist offered the balls for sale for $2 each as a commentary on the commercialism and vanity of the current art world
              </li>
              <li>The installation later moved to water, where the floating balls reflect the natural environment–and the viewers–around the work; water placement makes a stronger connection to the ancient myth
              </li>
              <li>Balls move with the currents of the water and wind, reflecting organically made, ever-changing viewpoints
              </li>
              <li>The installation has been exhibited in many places around the world, both in water and in dry spaces
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Narcissus Garden references the ancient myth of Narcissus, a young man who is so enraptured by his image in reflecting water that he stares at it indefinitely until he becomes a flower
              </li>
              <li>There is a deeper meaning today as Narcissus Garden references modern obsessions with selfies and uploaded images on social media
              </li>
              <li>Kusama is an internally renowned Japanese-bor artist
              <ul>
                <li>Got her start showing large works of art featuring huge polka dots
                </li>
                <li>One of the foremost innovators of Happenings
                </li>
                <li>Works in a wide variety of media, including installations
                </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
