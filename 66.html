      <h1>066. Annunciation Triptych (Merode Altarpiece). Workshop of Robert Campin. 1427- 1432 CE Oil on wood. </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Oil paint gives the surface a luminosity and shine
        -Oil allows for layers of glazes that render soft shadows
        -Oil can also be erased with turpentine, allowing for changes and corrections
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>-Left panel: donors, and middle-class people kneeling before the holy scene
        –Messenger appears at the gate to an enclosed garden.
        Center panel: Annunciation taking place in an everyday Flemish interior
        –Symbolism
        —--Towels and water represent Mary’s purity
        —--Flowers have three buds, symbolizing the Trinity; the unopened bud represents the unborn Jesus
        —---Mary is seated on a kneeler near the floor, symbolizing her humility
        —--Mary blocks the fireplace, the entrance to hell
        —--The candlestick symbolizes Mary holding Christ in the womb
        —--The Holy Spirit with a cross comes in through the window, symbolizing the divine birth
        –Humanization of traditional themes: no halos, domestic interiors, view into a Flemish cityscape
        –Right panel: Joseph is working in his carpentry workshop, the mousetraps on the windowsill and the workbench symbolize the capture of the devil
        </p>
  
      <h2>Function</h2>
      <p>-Meant to be in a private home for personal devotion
      </p>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>Context</p>
      <h2>Additional Information</h2>
      <p>--Unusually, the main panel was not commissioned
        -Wings were commissioned when the main panel was purchased; the donor portrait was added at this time.
        -After the donor's marriage in the 1430s, the wide and messenger were added, which accounts for the rather squeezed-in look of the donor's wife
