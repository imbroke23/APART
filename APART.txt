Name: 070. Palazzo Rucellai. Florence, Italy. Leon Battista Alberti (architect). c. 1450 CE Sone, masonry. 
Form:
-Three horizontal floors separated by a strongly articulated string course; each floor is shorter than the one below.
-Pilasters rise vertically and divide the spaces into squarish shapes
-AN emphasized cornice caps the building
-Square windows on the first floor; windows with mullions on the second and third floors
-Rejects rustication of earlier Renaissance palaces; used beveled masonry joints instead
-Benches on the lower level connect the palazzo with the city
Content:
-The articulation of the three stories links the building to the Colosseum levels, which have arches framed by columns: the first-floor pilasters are Tuscan; the second is Alberti’s own invention; the third is corinthian.
-Original building:
—Five bays on the left, with a central food
—Second doorway bay and right bay added later
—Eighth bay fragmentary: owners of the house next door refused to sell, and the Palazzo Rucellai never expanded.
Function:
-City residence of the Rucellai family
-The building format expresses classical humanist ideals for a residence: the bottom floor was used for business; the family received guests on the second floor; the family’s private quarters were on the third floor; the hidden fourth floor was for servants
