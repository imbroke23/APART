      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Shiva has four hands
        -One hand sounds the drum that he dances to; another carries a flame of destruction; the other two offer the abhaya murda, a gesture that allays fear.
        -Epicene quality shows an idealized, nearly nude, male figure
        -Flying locks of hair terminate in rearing cobra
        -Often depicted in a flaming nimbus, vigorously dancing with one foot on a dwarf, the Demon of Ignorance.
        -Fire around Shiva represents the borders of the Hindu cosmos covered with flowers when carried in processions.
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--Shiva periodically destroys the universe so that it can be reborn again.
        -He unfolds the universe out of the drum held in one of his right hands; he preserves it by uplifting his other right hand in a gesture indicating “do not be afraid.”
        -Shiva has a third eye barely suggested between his other two eyes; he once burned the Kama with this eye
        -The message is that belief in Shiva can achieve salvation
        </p>
