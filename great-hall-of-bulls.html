    </p>
    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>-How/Innovations
        --Natural products used to make paint: charcoal, iron ore, and plants
        --Paint colors were bound with animal fat
        --Lamps light the interior of the caves
        --Flat rocks were used as palettes
        --Evidence of scaffolding
        --Walls were scraped flat(ish)
        -2,000 figures in the cave: animals, humans, and abstract symbols in the chamber. However, no landscape or vegetation is shown.
        -Bodies of the bulls are shown in profile view with all 4 legs present. 
        -Bull's heads are shown in frontal view of their horns
        -Because a full profile would not show the whole animal, artists wanted to show the whole anatomy by drawing some in profile and some in frontal.
        -Twisted perspective: bodies in profile while horns are in frontal
