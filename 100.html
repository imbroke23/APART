          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>An orrery is an early form of planetarium, imitating the motion of the solar system
              </li>
              <li>The lamp in the center represents the sun; it is blocked by the silhouette of a figure
              </li>
              <li>All ages of man are represented by the mixed group of middle-class people in attendance
              </li>
              <li>Some curious, some contemplative, some in wonder, some fascinated
              </li>
              <li>The philosopher is based loosely on a portrait of Issac Newton; he is demonstrating an eclipse
              </li>
              <li>The philosopher stops to clarify a point for the note-taker on the left
              </li>

              <li>To complete the celestial theme, each face painting in an aspect of the phases of the moon
              </li>
              <li>Illustrates the eighteenth-century period called the Enlightenment and the democratization of knowledge
