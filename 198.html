      <h1>198. Borobudur Temple. Central Java, indonesia. Sailendra Dynasty. c. 750 -842 CE Volcanic-stone masonry. 
      </h1>
      <p>-There are four visible galleries containing 10 series of reliefs
        -To see all the reliefs in their correct order, one must walk around the monument 10 times covering a distance of nearly 3 miles
       - The base of Borobudur we see today is undecorated but it contains a hidden foot with reliefs depicting various visions of worldly desire. 
       - The original base was too narrow to support the monument hence it was subsequently encased with a new, broader but unadorned mantle of stones.
        </p>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Pyramid in the form: aligned with the four cardinal points of the compass/
        -Square-shaped plan with 4 entry points
        -Rubble faced with carved volcanic stone
        -Built on a low hill rising above a wide plain

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--This massive Buddhist monument contains 504 life-sized Buddhas, 1460 narrative reloef sculptures on 13000 panels 8200 feet long.
        -72 openwork stupas containing a Buddha, each with a preaching mudra
        -Six identical square terraces are placed one atop the other, like steps; three smaller circular terraces are placed on top; the lowest level functions as the base of the structure, with square floor plan; the second level recedes 23 feet from the edge of the base so that the space is wide enough for processions.
        -Each terrace is a level of enlightenment
        -On the top is an enclosed stupa
        -Divided into 3 sections: representing three levels of Buddhist cosmology.
        –Base: represents the lowest level of experience; those who are aligned with their desires on Earth; the world of desire and negative impulses; sculptures here show deeds of self-sacrifice practiced by the Buddha in his previous births and the story of his last incarnation as Prince Siddhartha
        –Body: five terraces in which people abandon their earthly desires; this is the world of forms–people have to control these negative impulses; sculptures here show the pilgrimage of the young man, Sudhana, who sets out in search of the Ultimate Truth.
        –Superstructure: an area that represents a formless world. In which a person experiences reality in its purest stage, where the physical world and worldly desire are expunged.
