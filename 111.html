          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>Color expresses emotions
              </li>
              <li>Rapid brushwork
              </li>
              <li>Recognizable forms–the ships, the hands, the chains–are reduced in size and pale in comparison with the mightiness of the turbulent seascape
              </li>
              <li>The bloody sunset acts as a symbol of the scene taking place
              </li>
              <li>Use of the sublime enhances dramatic impact
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Exhibited at the Royal Academy 1840, with an excerpt from Turner’s own poem called “The Fallacies of Hope:”
              <ul>
                <li>“Aloft all hands, strike the top-masts and belay; Yon angry setting sun and fierce-edged clouds Declare the Typhon’s coming. Before it sweeps your decks, throw overboard The dead and dying–ne’er heed their chains Hope, Jope, fallacious Hope! Where is they market now?”
                </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Based on a true story, an event in 1781 in which a slave ship, the Zong, sailed for the Americans full of slaves
              </li>
              <li>The slaves were insured against accidental drowning, but not insured against sickness; a policy instituted to force captains to treat slaves humanely
              </li>
              <li>Knowing that he would not collect insurance money on sick and dying slaves, the captain cast them overboard.
              </li>
              <li>Turner’s painting was inspired by an account of the scandal published in a book by Thomas Clarkson, which had been printed in 1839
              </li>
              <li>England freed the slaves in 1833 by an act of Parliament, however, there were exceptions, which were not addressed until 1843
              </li>
              <li>Nature responds to the inhumanity of the slave trade
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
