      <h1>Ecstasy of Saint Teresa. Cornaro Chapel, Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria. Rome, Italy. Gian Lorenzo Bernini. c. 1647- 1652 CE Marble, stucco and gilt bronze. </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Form
          <ul>
            <li>Marble is handled in a tactile way to reveal textures: skin is high gloss, feathers of angel are rougher, drapey is animated and fluid, clouds are roughly cut
            </li>
            <li>Figures seem to float in space; the rays of God’s light symbolically illuminate the scene from behind
            </li>
            <li>Natural light is redirected onto the sculpture from a window hidden above the work
            </li>
            <li>The work captures a moment in time–a characteristic of Baroque art
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Patronage
          <ul>
          <li>Stage-like setting with the patrons, members of the Cornaro family, sitting in theater boxes looking on and commenting
          </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Function and Context
          <ul>
            <li>Saint Teresa was canonized in 1622; a new saint at the time.
            </li>
            <li>This is a sculptural interpretation of Saint Teresa’s diary writings, in which she tells of her visions of God, many involving an angel descending with an arrow and plunging it into her
            </li>
            <li>Saint Teresa’s pose suggests sexual exhaustion, a feeling that is consistent with her description of spiritual ecstasy in her diary entries.
            </li>
            <li>This is a Counter-Reformation work that illustrates the use of images to increase piety and devotion among the Catholic Faithful
            </li>
            <li>It is located inside Santa Maria della Vittoria
            </li>
            <li>Cf. Visionary experience depicted in Lintel 25, Yaxchilan
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
