          <ul>
            <li>Broad forehead, pronounced downcast eye sockets, column-shaped nose: features associated with intellect and respect

        <li>Function
          <ul>
            <li>Presented at Mblo performances in which an individual is honored with ritual dances; tributes are performed in his or her honor
            </li>
            <li>The dancer who wears the mask and wears the clothes of the person for the performance is accompanied by the actual person in the performance
            </li>
            <li>The honoree receives a mask–artistic double of the person–as a gift

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>The masks are commissioned by a group of admirers, not by an individual; this one was made by the artist Owie Kimou

            <li>The masks are an idealized representation of a real person
            </li>
            <li>This is the idealized representation of Moya Yanso

            <li>From the Ivory Coast.
