      <li>Installation containing millions of individually handcrafted ceramic pieces resembling sunflower seeds</li>
      <li>They symbolically represent an ocean of fathomless depth; each seed is made in Jingdezhen, a city known for its porcelain production in Imperial China</li>
      <li>The individual seed is lost among a sea of seeds, representing the loss of individuality in the modern world</li>
      <li>Six hundred artisans worked for two years each seed is handpainted.</li>

          <li>Ai Weiwei is a Chinese artist</li>
            <li>Sunflower seeds were eaten as a source of food during the famine era under Mao Tze-tung</li>
              <li>The work reflects the ideology of Chairman Mao: he was the sun; his followers were the seeds</li>
                <li>Originally a viewer could walk on the installation, but it raised harmful ceramic dust; viewing was then limited to the sidelines</li>
