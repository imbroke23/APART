      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Installation containing millions of individually handcrafted ceramic pieces resembling sunflower seeds
        -They symbolically represent an ocean of fathomless depth; each seed is made in Jingdezhen, a city known for its porcelain production in Imperial China
        -The individual seed is lost among a sea of seeds, representing the loss of individuality in the modern world
        -Six hundred artisans worked for two years each seed is handpainted.

      <p>--Ai Weiwei is a Chinese artist
        -Sunflower seeds were eaten as a source of food during the famine era under Mao Tze-tung
        -The work reflects the ideology of Chairman Mao: he was the sun; his followers were the seeds
        -Originally a viewer could walk on the installation, but it raised harmful ceramic dust; viewing was then limited to the sidelines
