      <h1>Woman Holding a Balance. Johannes Vermeer. c. 1664 CE Oil on canvas.
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Form and Content
          <ul>
            <li>Light enters from the left, illuminating the figures and warmly highlighting textures and surfaces: the woman’s garments, wooden table, marble checkerboard floor, jewelry, the painting, etc
            </li>
            <li>A moment in time: stillness and timelessness
            </li>
            <li>The woman is dressed in fine, fur-trimmed clothing
            </li>
            <li>Geometric lines focus on a central point at the pivot of balance
            </li>
            <li>The figure seems unaware of the viewer’s presence
            </li>
            <li>Her pensive stillness suggests she may be weighing something more profound than jewelry
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>A small number of Vermeer works are in existence
            </li>
            <li>Except for two landscapes, Vermeer’s work portrays intimate scenes in the interior of Dutch homes.
            </li>
            <li>The viewer looks into a private world in which seemingly small gestures take on a significance greater than what first appears
            </li>
            <li>A family member may have posed for the painting, perhaps Vermeer’s wife, Caterina.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Theories
          <ul>
            <li>Is it a genre scene or an allegory? Or both?
            </li>
            <li>A moment of weighing and judging
            </li>
            <li>In the background is a painting of the Last Judgment, a time of weighing souls:

              <ul>
                <li>The woman is at a midpoint between earthly jewels and spiritual goals such as meditation and temperance.
                </li>
                <li>The balance has nothing in it, pearls and coins on the table waiting to be measured may be symbolic of a balanced state of mind.
                </li>
                <li>The balancing reference perhaps relates to the unborn child
                </li>
                <li>This is Catholic subject matter in a Protestant country; Vermeer and his family were Catholic.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Vanitas painting gold should not be a false allure
            </li>
            <li>Vermeer may have used a camera obscura
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
