      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-A narrative work that is read from right to left as the scroll is unrolled
        -Point of view: one looks down from above onto the scene, which takes place in Kyoto
        -Strong diagonals emphasize movement and action
        -Swift, active brush strokes
        -Depersonalized figures; many with only one stroke for the eyes, ears, and mouth
        -Tangled mass of forms accentuated by Japanese armor
        -Final scene: lone archer leads the escape from the burning palace with the Japanese commander behind him.
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--Military rule in Japan from 1185 on had an interest in the code of the warrior; reflected in the large quantity of war-related literature and paintings

        -Burning of the imperial palace at Sanjo in Kyoto as rebel forces try to seize power by captivity
