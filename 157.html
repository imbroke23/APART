        <li>Context
          <ul>
            <li>Coyolxauhqui and her many brothers plotted the death of her mother. Coatlicue, who became pregnant after tucking a ball of feathers down her bosom. When Coyolxauhqui chopped off Coatlicuâ€™s head, a child, Huitzilopochtli, popped out of the severed body fully grown and dismembered Coyolxauhqui, who fell dead at the base of the shrine.
            </li>
            <li>This stone represents the dismembered moon goddess, Coyolxauhqui, who is placed at the base of the twin pyramids of Tenochtitlan.
            </li>
            <li>Aztecs similarly dismembered enemies and threw them down the stairs of the great pyramid to land on the sculpture of Coyolxauhqui
            </li>
            <li>Aztecs sacrificed people and then threw their dismembered remains down the steps of the temple as Huitzilopochtli did to Coyolxauhqui.
            </li>
            <li>A relationship was established between the death and decapitation of Coyolxauqui with the sacrifice of enemies at the top of Aztec pyramids
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

              <li>Olmec works have a characteristic frown on the face; pungnacious visage; baby face; a cleft in the center of the head carved from greenstone
              </li>
              <li>Shows that the Aztecs collected and embraced artwork from other cultures, including early Mexican cultures such as the Olmec and Teotihuacan
              </li>
              <li>Shows that the Aztecs had a wide-ranging merchant network that traded historical items
