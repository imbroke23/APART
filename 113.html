        <h1>113. The Stone Breakers. Gustave Corbet. 1849 CE (destroyed in 1945) Oil on Canvas. 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>Peasants are breaking stones down to rubble to be used for paving 
              </li>
              <li>Poverty emphasized
              </li>
              <li>The figures are born poor, will remain poor their whole lives
              </li>
              <li>No idealization of peasant life or of the working poor
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>Large massive figures dominate the composition; a style usually reserved for mythic figures in painting
              </li>
              <li>Thick heavy paint application
              </li>
              <li>Browns and ochres are dominant hues reflecting the drudgery of peasant life
              </li>
              <li>Concentration on the main figures; little in the foreground or background to detract from them
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Function
            <ul>
              <li>Submitted to the Salon of 1850-1851
              </li>
              <li>Large size of painting usually reserved for grand historical paintings; this work elevates the commonplace into the realm of legend and history
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Reacting to labor unrest of 1848, which demanded better working conditions
              </li>
              <li>Reflects a greater understanding of those who spend their entire lives in misery
              </li>
              <li>Courbet’s words: “I stopped to consider two men breaking stones on the highway. It’s rare to meet the most complete expression of poverty, so an idea of a picture came to me on the spot. I made an appointment with them at my studio for the next day.. On the one side is an old man, seventy… On the other side is a young fellow… in his filthy tattered shirt. Alas, in labor such as this, one’s life begins that way, and it ends the same way.”
