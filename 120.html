        <h1>120. The Starry Night. Vincent van Gogh. 1889 CE Oil on canvas, 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>Thick, short brushstrokes
              </li>
              <li>Heavy application of paint called impasto
              </li>
              <li>Parts of the canvas can be seen through the brushwork; artist need not fill in every part of the surface
              </li>
              <li>Strong left-to-right wave-like impulse in the work broken only by the tree and the church steeple
              </li>
              <li>The tree looks like green flames reaching into a sky that is exploding with stars over placid village
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>The mountains in the distance are the ones that Van Gogh could see from his hospital room in Saint=Remy; steepness exaggerated
              </li>
              <li>Combination of images: Dutch church, crescent moon, Mediterranean cypress tree.
              </li>
              <li>Cypresses were often associated with cemeteries
              </li>
              <li>Landscape painting was popular in the late nineteenth century as a reaction to the industrialization of cities
              </li>
            </ul>
