            <ul>
              <li>Using schematic means, Kandinsky depicts cataclysmic events on the left and a sense of spiritual salvation on the right

          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Kandinsky wanted the viewer to respond to a painting the way one would to an abstract musical composition: a concerto, a sonata, a symphony
              </li>
              <li>The artist felt that sound and color were linked; for example, it was possible to hear color
              </li>
              <li>He used words such as ¨composition¨ and ¨improvisation¨ in the titles of his works, words associated with musical composition
              </li>
              <li>Kandinsky's works have a relationship to atonal music, which was evolving at this time
              </li>
              <li>Movement toward abstraction; representational objects suggested rather than depicted
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
