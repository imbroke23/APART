        <ul>
          <li>Patronage
            <ul>
              <li>Hired by Leland Stanford to settle a bet to see if a horseâ€™s four hooves could be off the ground at the same time during a natural gallop
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Technique
            <ul>
              <li>The photographer used a device called a zoopraxiscope to settle the bet
              </li>
              <li>Cameras snap photos at evenly spaced points along a track, giving the effect of things happening in a sequence
              </li>
              <li>For the time, it was very fast shutter speeds, nearly 1/2000th of a second
              </li>
              <li>Photography now advanced enough that it can capture moments the human eye cannot
              </li>
              <li>These motion studies bridge the gap between still photography and motion pictures
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>One photograph with sixteen separate images of a horse galloping
              </li>
              <li>Images could be played in a sequence to stimulate motion pictures
              </li>
