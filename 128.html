        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>Little of the human form is actually seen: two heads four hands, two feet
              </li>
              <li>The bodies are suggested under a sea of richly designed patterning
              </li>
              <li>The work is spaced in an indeterminate location against a flattened background
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Content
            <ul>
              <li>The male figure is composed of large rectangular boxes; the female figure is composed of circular forms
              </li>
              <li>The work suggests all-consuming love; passion; eroticism
              </li>
              <li>The use of gold lead is reminiscent of Byzantine mosaics
              </li>
              <li>The work is influenced by gold applied to medieval illuminated manuscripts
              </li>
              <li>Part of a movement called the Vienna Succession, which broke away from academic training in schools at that time.
