      <h1>073. Last Supper. Leonardo da Vinci. c. 1494- 1498 CE Oil and Tempera. 
      </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-Linear perspective orthogonal of the ceiling and floor point to Jesus
        -Apostles are grouped in sets of three
        -Jesus is alone before a group of three windows, a symbol of the Trinity
        -A rounded pediment over Jesus’s head acts as a symbolic halo; Leonardo subtlety suggests Jesus’s divinity
        Materials: Leonardo experimented with a combination of paints to yield a greater chiaroscuro; however, the paints began to peel off the wall in Leonardo’s lifetime. As a result, the painting has been restored many times and is a shadow of itself
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>--Great drama of the moment: Jesus says, “One of you will betray me”(Mathew 26:21); Jesus also blesses the bread and wine, creating a sacred Eucharist(Mathew 26:21).
        –Various reactions on the faces of the apostles: surprise, fear, anger, denial, suspicion; anguish on the face of Jesus
        -Judas, the betrayer, falls back clutching his bag of coins; his face is symbolically in darkness.
        -The only Leonardo da Vinci work remaining in situ
        </p>
  
      <h2>Function</h2>
