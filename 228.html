        <h1>228. Androgyne III. Magdalena Abakanowicz. 1985 CE Burlap, resin, wood, nails and string. 
      </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Form
            <ul>
              <li>The figure sits on a low stretcher of wooden legs, substituting for human legs
              </li>
              <li>The figure is hollowed out, just a shell
              </li>
              <li>The figure is placed to be seen in the round: the complete back and the hollow front are visible.
              </li>
              <li>The pose suggests meditation and/or perseverance
              </li>
              <li>Sexual characteristics are minimized to increase the universality of the figure; hence the title Androgyne, or an androgynous figure, one that is neither male nor female.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Materials
            <ul>
              <li>The work is made of hardened fiber casts from plaster molds
              </li>
              <li>The hardened fiber has the appearance of crinkled human skin set in earth tones
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Magdalena Abankanowicz was a Polish artist who endured WWII, the Nazi occupation of Poland, and the Stainist rule
              </li>
              <li>Since 1974, the artist had been making similar figures, often without heads or arms, in large groups or singly.
