      <h1>229. A Book from the Sky. Xu Bing. 1987-1991 CE Mixed media installation. 
      </h1>
  
      <h2>Form</h2>
      <p>-The work references Chinese art forms: scrolls, screens, books, and paper
        -Four hundred handmade books are placed in rows on the ground
        -One walks beneath printed scrolls hanging from the ceiling
        -All of the Chinese characters are inventions of the artist and have no meaning
        -The artist uses traditional Asian wood-block techniques
        </p>
  
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>-Original title: “An Analyzed Reflection of the End of This Century”
        -Originally in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Beijing; filled a large exhibition space
        -The artist lost favor with the Communist government over this work
        -Mounted at many venues in the west afterward
        
        -Xu Bing is a Chinese-born artist and U.S. resident
        -The artist was trained in the propagandistic socialist realist style; that background led to his critique of power in works such as this one
        -Criticized as “bourgeois liberation”; it was claimed that its meaninglessness hid secret subversions; others interpret the meaningless characters as reflecting meaningless words found in political double-speak.
