      <h1>207. Ryoan-ji. Kyoto, Japan. Muromachi period, Japan. c. 1480 CE; the current design most likely dates to the 18th century. Rock garden.</h1>
      
      <p>Garden as a microcosm of nature-
        Zen dry garden:
        Represents water; gravel is raked in wavy patterns daily by monks-
        Rocks represent mountain ranges-
        Asymmetrical arrangement-
        The garden is bounded on two sides by a low, yellow wall-
        Fifteen rocks arranged in three groups interpreted as-
        —-Islands in a floating sea
        —-Mountain peaks above clouds
        —-Constellations in the sky
        —-A tiger taking her cubs across a stream
        -Meant to be viewed from a veranda in a nearby building, the abbot’s residence
        -From no viewpoint is the entire garden viewable at once
        -Garden served as a focus for meditation; in a sense, a harden entered by the mind
        –Wet garden:
        —Contains a teahouse
        —Seemingly arbitrary in placement, the plants are actually placed in a highly organized and structured environment symbolizing the natural world
        —Water symbolizes purification; used in rituals
