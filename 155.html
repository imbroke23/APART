            <li>Form and Content
              <ul>
                <li>The lintel was originally set above the central doorway of structure 23 as a part of a series of three lintels
                </li>
                <li>Lady Xook(bottom right) invokes the Vision Serpent to commemorate her husband’s rise to the throne
                </li>
                <li>The Vision Serpent has two heads: one has a warrior emerging from its mouth, and the other has Tlaloc, a war god
                </li>
                <li>She holds a bowl with bloodletting ceremonial items: stinging spine and bloodstained paper; she runs a rope with thorns through her tongue
                </li>
                <li>She burns paper on a dish as a gift to the netherworld
                </li>
                <li>The depicted ritual was conducted to commemorate the accession of Shield Jaguar II to the throne
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Function
              <ul>
                <li>Linetls intended to relay a message of the foundation of the site–there was a long pause in the building’s history
                </li>
                <li>Shield Jaguar’s building program throughout the city may have been an attempt to reinforce his lineage and his right to rule
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Context
              <ul>
                <li>The building is dedicated to Lady Xook, Shield Jaguars II’s wife
                </li>
                <li>The inscription is written as a mirror image–extremely unusual among Mayan glyphs; uncertain meaning, perhaps indicating she had a vision from the other side of existence and she was acting as an intercessor or shaman
                </li>
                <li>The inscription names the protagonist as Shield Jaguar II
                </li>
                <li>Bloodletting is central to the Mayan life. When a member of the royal family sheds his or her blood, a portal to the netherworld is opened and gods and spirits enter the world
                </li>

              </ul>
              <li>Theory
                <ul>
                  <li>Some scholars suggest that the serpent on this lintel and elsewhere depicts an ancestral spirit or founder of the kingdom
                  </li>
                </ul>
