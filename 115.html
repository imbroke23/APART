        <h1>115. Olympia. Edouard Manet. 1863 CE Oil on canvas. 
        </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Form and Content
            <ul>
              <li>Olympiaâ€™s frank, direct, uncaring, and unnerving look startled viewers
              </li>
              <li>The figure is cold and uninviting; no mystery, no joy
              </li>
              <li>No idealization of the female nude
              </li>
              <li>The maid delivers flowers from an admirer; a cat responds to our entry into the room
              </li>
              <li>Simplified modeling; active brushwork
              </li>
              <li>Stark contrast of colors
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Reception
            <ul>
              <li>Exhibited at the Salon of 1865; created a scandal
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Context
            <ul>
              <li>Olympia was a common prostitute name of the time
              </li>
              <li>A mistress was common to upper-class Parisian men, often sympathetically portrayed in contemporary literature, but never so brazenly depicted as in this painting
              </li>
              <li>The painting is inspired by Titian's Venus of Urbino and seen as a modern commentary on the classical feminine nude
              </li>
              <li>This painting is a reaction to academic art that was based on Renaissance and classical ideals
              </li>
              <li>Images of prostitutes and black women are not new with this painting, but Manet creates a dialogue between the nude prostitute and the clothed black servant, named Laure, which brings up issues of sexuality, racism, and stereotypes
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
